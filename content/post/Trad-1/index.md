# Chapter 79 - Inter-class Ball Game Competition (7) -Together-

「Haan… Ahn… Hnn! Y, Yuu-kun, geez, you’re just like a baby. Do you like boobs that much?」

Hugging Yuu, Youko gently stroked not only his back, but also his head as if she was caressing a baby.

「Hmm? Yes, I love them. Why? Is it strange?」

「Nghh… Hnn, for an adolescent boy to love boobs, I don’t think I’ve heard such a case much. Right, Kazumi?」

「Ahn. That may be the case… But if it’s you, Yuu-kun, feel free to touch them anytime you want.」

「Even if I suddenly touch them in the hallway?」

「Yes. Touch them to your heart’s content.」

「Mine too!」

To receive permission to touch their breasts when he ran into them in the hallway of the school, talk about delightful thing.

But for now, Yuu decided to enjoy the sex with these two.

Thinking back, these two were the youngest of all the women that Yuu had been with so far, at 15 years old.

However, just as Yuu himself already had a mature body and splendid sexual organs, Youko and Kazumi had bodies that had fully grown up as women, and they were reacting sensitively.

Moreover, their skin was also youthful, firm and supple, and felt springy and juicy to the touch.

The girls’ bodies, which had just begun to change from that of a child to that of an adult, greatly stirred Yuu’s desire.

Having switched positions with Kazumi, right now, Youko was sitting on top of Yuu who was now sitting on the toilet seat, connected in a face-to-face sitting position.

Youko was a little taller than him, so her breasts were sticking out toward him in the perfect position.

When he penetrated Youko with his penis, which remained erect even right after ejaculating, she seemed to feel a little pain, but the pleasure and delight of having her first sexual experience with Yuu seemed to outweigh it.

Likewise, even though the virgin membrane was no longer there, the inside of Youko, who was an athletic girl, boasted very great tightness, and it felt so good that Yuu felt like he was going to come when he penetrated her all the way to her deepest part.

Having ejaculated once, Yuu had a little more leeway than when he did it with Kazumi, but as opposed to moving as soon as the penetration was complete, he rolled up her gym uniform, took off her bra, and sucked on her modest but perky upturned breasts.

Asking Kazumi to come next to him too, he stroked her body, which stirred his male instincts, around and fondled her breasts.

「Shall we get started, Youko? Do you want to be the one to move? Or do you want me to?」

When Yuu looked up at her, Youko, whose expression had started to turn melty, nodded her head and pressed her lips against his.

「Hnn, nmm, chuu, chuu… Yuu-kun, please.」

「Alright.」

In a state where she was sitting with his back straight, Yuu held Kazumi close to him with his right hand, while his left hand firmly held Youko’s thin waist, and he began to shake his hips little by little.

「Ahn, hnn, fwah! Ahn! Amazing, it’s poking me so rapidly! Ahn, ahn, so good, it feels so good, Yuu-kuun… Yuu-kun filling up, my inside, with his thing… It, it feels so good!」

「M, me too, inside of you, it feels so good, Youko! Nmm!」

It seemed that Youko belonged to the track club during her middle school days, and as one would expect from someone who had been working out and training all the time, the tightness was nothing short of great.

He could feel her tightly clamping down on his penis, which was snugly penetrating her all the way to the deepest part.

On the other hand, as Youko recovered from the shock of welcoming a penis into her for the first time, this time, her sensuality as a woman wouldn’t stop tingling, making her feel as if it was not her own body, and she had no choice but to cling to Yuu while moaning.

There, Kazumi threw her arms around Yuu and took his lips.

「Nmm, chuu… how… nice. It kinda makes me want to do it again, too.」

「Hahaha. We’re doing it in turns, so wait until I’m done with Youko, okay?」

「T, that’s right… Right now, it’s my turn, after all! I’m getting scrapped… in my deepest part! Hnn, ahn! That, it, it feels so good! Hiin, hiin, I’m going to… cum again!」

As Yuu began to attack her in a motion as if he was scrapping, gouging the deepest part of her vagina, Youko, unable to endure it, jerked her chin up.

Yuu licked up Youko’s slender neck with his tongue, which was still dripping with saliva as it had been twining together with Kazumi’s.

「Feel free to cum. There, go ahead and cum, Youko!」

「Nghh… Hnn, cumming! Ahn, Yuu-kun is making me cum! Ahn, aaaaaaaaah!! Cumming---!!!」

「amm, hnn, nmm, chuu… chuu, slurp, puha, lick… lick… Ahn, hnn… Yuu-kun… so lovely… Nghh, auu… Ahn! No, my body is… melting away---」

「Ah… Youko… Nghh, guh…」

「Ah… Ah… It’s so amazing… Yuu-kun, I love you… Nmm, chuu.」

Yuu was holding Youko’s thin waist tightly with both hands as he thrusted his hips upward.

With a melty look on her face, Youko was holding Yuu’s head in her arms, occasionally kissing him over and over again, and jerking her chin up and moaning as she could no longer hold back the pleasure.

「Can you see it? Youko. The part where we’re connected has become sopping wet, no?」

「Umm… You’re… right…」

When she moved her body away slightly from him and looked down, as expected she could not see the part where his penis entered her vagina, but she could see their lower abdomen glistening wet with sweat and love juices.

Since a while ago, their coupling tools had been making a loud, lewd, squelching sound as they moved.

Also, Kazumi, who had been watching the two of them engaging in the act up close, clung to Yuu’s shoulder, twisted her thighs together and began to play with her own secret place with her fingers, letting out hot breaths.

「Thanks to your squirt, I’m sopping wet, Youko.」

「To think Youko would cum so grandly.」

「No… you two… don’t say that… ahn!」

「It’s okay. If anything, for both of you to feel so much pleasure even though this is your first time having sex, it makes me very happy as a man.」

Partly because they had ended up spending so much time masturbating in the last month as they thought about Yuu, now that they finally got to do the real deal with him for the first time like this, the two ended up becoming more debauched than expected.

Having heard beforehand that women with too strong sexual desires were disliked by boys, they had always kept in mind to carry themselves in a little more ladylike manner, but it crumbled easily in front of Yuu.

Their bodies reacted more sensitively than they had expected, and their rationality ended up melting away in a matter of seconds.

They were like females in heat.

And yet, when Yuu showed them a pleasant smile, their favorability of him was as good as shooting through the limit.

「Haa, haa… I’m about to cum too, Youko. Just like this, I’m going to cum inside you. That’s okay, right?」

As far as Youko was concerned, the only answer she could think of was Yes.

「L, let it out! Your semen, I want you to let out a lot of it inside me, Yuu-kun! Kyaun! Your dick, it’s so amaziiiiiing!」

「Guh, Youko, ohh, ooh!」

The feeling of being stroked by the vaginal walls, which were clamping down on him be it when he pulled out or pushed in, led Yuu to ejaculation.

Getting closer and closer to that moment, they hugged each other tightly, and Yuu thrust his hips up furiously.

「Y, Youko, guh! I’m cumming!」

「Ahh, ahn! Me too, nghh, ahn… aaaaaaaaaaaaah!! C, cumming!!!」

_Splurt, splurt_ At the same time as a large amount of semen was poured into her womb, _splash, splash_ Youko reached climax and squirted grandly, soaking Yuu’s lower abdomen once again.

---

Currently, in front of Yuu, Youko was standing on the left and Kazumi was standing on the right side with their hands pressed against the door, sticking their buttocks out a little and exposing their bare lower bodies.

The space was too small for the two of them to stand side by side, so they were pretty much in a state of sticking close to each other, shoulder to shoulder.

Perhaps in part because they had been training their bodies through athletic activities since their middle school days, they boasted young, toned figures and plump, shapely buttocks, which aroused Yuu’s worldly desires.

Not only from the front, even if you looked at them from behind, the two of them were overflowing with charm.

Their legs were slightly spread apart, and a white, muddy, though somewhat transparent, lewd juice was trickling down their thighs from their vaginas.

As they took a break, Yuu sat on the toilet seat with both of them sitting on his laps, but then a thought suddenly occurred to him and he made a request to the two, saying 「Please let me take a good look at your behinds.」

Complying with that request of his, the two turned their bare buttocks toward him and begged Yuu for his penis, so unable to resist it, he stood up. His crotch had also stood up at the same time.

Spreading his arms out from the middle, he held the two of them in his arms, brought their bodies close to each other, and forcefully squeezed his hard meat rod in between their buttocks.

「「Ahn!」」

Both Youko and Kazumi were startled by the hard penis touching their buttocks, but in unison, they turned to Yuu and showed a yearning look on their faces.

「Yuu-kun, I want you… to quickly, put your dick into me…」

「M, me too, I kinda want you to put it in me again!」

「No. You just had Yuu-kun pour his semen into you, didn’t you, Youko?」

「I mean-」

「Fufufu, both of you are cute and have nice figures, on top of that you’re very naughty, which is nice.」

As Yuu stretched his back and brought his mouth closer, the two twisted their necks and competed to take his lips.

First of all, he kissed Youko on the left side, and then Kazumi right after.

As he kissed the two alternately over and over again, he licked their lips with his tongue, and as he did so, the other party also brought her tongue closer toward his, and they began to twine their tongues together.

It was on the level that every time Yuu turned his face to the left or right, a string of drool would be drawn and fall down.

After indulging himself in the oral pleasure to his heart’s content with both of them in such a manner, Yuu shifted his hips to the right side, in other words, to Kazumi’s buttocks.

「This time, it’s Kazumi’s turn.」

「Ahaan. I’m so happy!」

「Take it.」

「Aahn! It came into me! Yuu-kun’s dick… Ahn… so good!」

Even though she had just gotten accustomed to Yuu’s penis during her first experience, Kazumi’s vagina was still showing resistance as if it was trying to push back the invading foreign object.

There, he persistently made his way through it and completed the penetration all the way to her deepest part.

「Ahh, hnn! As I thought… It’s so amazing. It’s reaching all the way… to my deepest part.」

「Kuh-. As I thought, inside of you is so tight, Kazumi. But I think I can move better than before. I’m going to go at it hard, okay?!」

Yuu started to pump in and out of her with big strokes.

_Squelch, squelch_ As it sucked the long-awaited meat rod deep into it, Kazumi’s vagina drooled with delight and began to make a loud, wet sound.

Each time Kazumi was vigorously poked in the deepest part of her vagina, she jerked her chin up and moaned with her tongue sticking out.

「Ahh, ahn, ahn, ahn! Yuu-kun… Yuu-kun! It feels… so good! Hiin, ahh, nghh.」

「Ahn-. How nice. Hey, Yuu-kun! Quickly put it in me, too.」

Finding Youko adorable as she begged him while shaking her buttocks slightly, Yuu patted her on the head with his left hand, before then slowly moving his hand down from there to her back and then to her buttocks, and grabbed her tightly there. Rubbing her vaginal opening with his fingers, he inserted his middle finger deep inside her.

「Hiun!」

「Hold on a sec, okay? I’m going to put my dick into you two in turns. Let’s see, let’s take turns each time you cum.」

「Ufufu… Got it. Looking at how Kazumi is doing, I think we’ll take turns soon.」

「Noo… I, I’m still fine, so…ahn!」

---

Smack, smack, smack!

Every time Yuu slammed his hips against her buttocks, a pleasant sound echoed through the toilet stall.

「Ahn, ahn, ahn, hiin… Hii, hiin! I’m cumming… even though… I don’t want to cum yet… Ahh, hnn! I can’t… hold it in anymoreeee.」

Letting out coquettish cries as she dropped drops of sweat, drool, and love juice on the floor, Kazumi was at the mercy of the upward thrusts of the manhood penetrating her lower abdomen.

Her hair, which had been neatly weaved into braids, had ended up becoming completely disheveled after being shaken around so much.

Sticking his upper body close to her back and holding her breasts tight with his right hand as he fondled them, Yuu made a sharp upward thrust all the way to her deepest part, and this time, he switched his movement to a circular one.

「Ahiii! That’s… not good… Ahh! Ahh, ahh, ahh, aaaaaaaaaaaah! I, I, I’m cumming---!!!」

As soon as Yuu saw Kazumi arching her body back, he pulled out his penis with a sticky pop.

「Alright, this time it’s Youko’s turn, so get some rest, Kazumi.」

He lightly slapped her buttocks, but Kazumi, who was pressing her face against the door, didn’t seem to have the leeway to say anything back.

Pulling out his finger, which he had inserted into Youko’s vagina, and licking the liquid that had covered it down to the base, Yuu moved a little to the left side with a bold smile on his face. He positioned himself at the center of Youko’s buttocks.

「Sorry to keep you waiting, Youko.」

「Aahn… Yuu…kuun-」

As if the climax had ended up getting transmitted to her from Kazumi given that their bodies had been in close contact with each other, Youko turned around and looked at Yuu with a flushed face.

When he put the glans into her wet, shiny, and twitching chasm, which seemed to have been eagerly waiting for his penis, the well loosened secret place slipperily swallowed it.

When most of the glans had slipped into her vagina, he was faced with resistance by the vaginal flesh, but then, he penetrated it by force.

「Ahh, huh?! Nghh… Hii, hii, hiin! Yu… u… ku… W, wait… Ahh, hiin!」

「There you go, all the way to the deepest part… have I come!」

「Ahh-, ohh, ohh, ooooooh… Ahh, hii… Hnn, hnn, nghh-, hnn…」

「Hmm? What’s wrong, Youko?」

The moment he finished the insertion and penetrated her all the way to her deepest part, Youko arched her body back in the same way as Kazumi did a moment ago. As if trying to hold on to something, she raised both of her hands and scraped her nails against the door.

「By some chance, did you cum?」

「Ha!」

「You cum, didn’t you? Kufufu… We’re taking turns then-」

Apparently, Youko’s sensitive body had ended up learning portio-cumming during her first experience, which was unusual, and it seemed that even now, she ended up coming as she got poked there.

「N… noo… So suddenly, I’ve never experienced something like this before! With a gush, something hot suddenly welled up from the depth of my body… and I had no time to hold it in…」

Her face beet red, Youko was in a total panic.

「Fine. I’ll feel sorry if we take turns here, after all. I’ll give you a one turn freebie. I wonder if you’ll be able to hold out a little longer until your next cum?」

Saying so, Yuu started to pump in and out slowly.

「Ahn, thank you, Yuu-kun… Hnn, hnn, hnn, auu! But, the good feeling is… never stopping! Hyaan! I feel like… I’m going to cum again!」

---

The moment they came, both Youko and Kazumi clamped down on Yuu so hard that it felt as if they were trying to squeeze the sperm out of him, but despite that, he had been able to endure it, which was probably because he had ejaculated twice and because he pulled his penis out immediately and paused for a moment.

If he had continued to shake his hips as he was, he might have ended up coming much earlier.

Even so, as he penetrated the two alternately over and over again, the urge to ejaculate was building up inside Yuu.

「Ah, ahii, hii, hii, hiin! Hii, hii! I’m going to cum… again! Noo, Yuu-kun’s dick, is too amazing… I can’t stand it… Ahh, ahn! That place is… cumming, cumming, cumming!」

Still spreading his arms to hold both of them together, Yuu was shaking his hips against Kazumi.

Kazumi, who was being pounded hard from behind, was in a state where she could barely hold up her body, which was on the verge of collapsing, by pressing both of her hands against the door.

「Guh… I, I’m also… going to cum! T, to finish it off… I want to cum into your mouths.」

「Y, yes. Sure, Yuu-kun.」

Kazumi, who had just come, seemed to have no leeway to respond to him, but Youko twisted her body and nodded with a smile.

「Guh! I’m already!」

After nailing Kazumi’s buttocks a few more times, Yuu hastily pulled his penis out.

Then, as if having been waiting for that moment, Youko lowered her body, clung to Yuu’s waist, and held his penis as she sucked on the glans.

As soon as she turned around in a hurry, Kazumi also began to suck on his penis.

Getting their heads stroked by Yuu, who was standing straight, the two of them sucked on his penis lovingly.

It was slippery with love juice from both of them, but they didn’t seem to mind.

「Haan… your dick is, pulsating, so amazing…」

「Ahh, kaha… H, here I… come…」

「Slurp, chuupa… Come, Yuu-kun…」

「Ohh, oooh! I’m cumming!」

Urged by the movement of their hands and tongues, _splurt_ his semen spurt out vigorously.

The semen went into the wide-open mouths of Youko and Kazumi, who had been waiting for it, and when they swallowed it down in a single gulp, more of it was continuously poured all over their faces, including the tips of their noses, cheeks, and chins.

「Amm, Yuu-kun’s sperm… so superb.」

「Aahn, there’s so much of this… thick and hot stuff…」

For Yuu, this was his third shot, but partly because he had held it in for an extended period of time, he felt like he was shooting out more semen than usual.

Both Youko and Kazumi were savoring it in a dreamy state.

---

「Yuu-kun, are you okay with the bus time?」

「Err, you see, there are some classes that are having celebratory party today, so I should still have plenty of time to catch it.」

「I see. Thank goodness.」

After putting their clothes back on, the three of them walked down the empty hallway, hand in hand.

As they drew closer to the first school building, they could hear the faint sound of happy voices.

The celebratory party held by the classes that had won first place in their grade was probably still going on.

Unfortunately, they failed to win first place, but for Youko and Kazumi, the reward time they had in the gym storage room as well as the fact that they were embraced by Yuu a short while ago had turned into the most treasured memories of their lives.

「I’ll be on my way then.」

Walking through the courtyard, they parted at the halfway point along the connecting passageway.

From there, Yuu planned to go back to his classroom, the boys’ class in the second school building.

「Yes. Thank you for today.」

「Really… It’s on the level where we can never thank you enough.」

「Hahaha. Likewise, I’m glad I was able to spend a wonderful time with you two.」

「「Yuu-kun!」」

Both Youko and Kazumi didn’t want to let go of the hand they were holding and wanted to stay in touch with Yuu all the time.

But they knew that that wouldn’t be possible.

「I’ll see you tomorrow or next week at school.」

「Be careful on your way home.」

「T, then… bye-bye.」

Letting go of their hands, Yuu waved at the two and started walking towards the second school building.

The two of them sent him off at that spot until they could no longer see Yuu’s figure.

Youko, who had been facing forward, turned her eyes toward Kazumi.

Perhaps sensing that gaze of hers, her eyes met Kazumi’s.

「Hmm? What’s wrong, Youko?」

「We met Yuu-kun when we went to observe the basketball club in April, and we’ve gotten close with each other through the boys-girls social events that have been held up until now, right?」

「Yes. We were also in the same group during the new students orienteering event and he cheered us on at the inter-class ball game competition.」

「You and I have always been together with Yuu-kun, haven’t we?」

「Yes, we have always been together.」

Youko quietly held out her hand.

「Youko?」

「I think I’m really glad that I became friends with you when we entered high school, Kazumi. If possible, I even want us to remain friends until we graduate.」

「I, I think so… too!」

「Fufufu. That makes me happy. In that case, you see, let’s do our best together in regard to Yuu-kun, too!」

「Huh?」

「I think there is probably someone else whom Yuu-kun loves the most. If we go by the rumor, it’s the student council president, I guess? But, you see, don’t you think we’re definitely the ones in the lead among the first-year students?」

「Is, is that so…」

When she was with Yuu, Kazumi tended to get obsessed with him and show some assertiveness, but she was a meek person by nature, so she didn’t quite have the confidence to affirm it.

「Yes, it is, for sure.」

In contrast to Kazumi, Youko’s attitude was overflowing with confidence.

「For now, it’s fine even if we’re not his number one. But, during the period of time until we graduate, I think it would be nice if you and I could secure a place by Yuu-kun’s side. Don’t you think so too, Kazumi?」

「I, I! Yes, I want to be by Yuu-kun’s side!」

Getting asked by Youko, Kazumi boldly nodded her head in agreement.

「There are a lot of girls who like Yuu-kun, so you see… I think there will be no shortage of rivals from now on, too. As such, what do you say about teaming up with me and forming a united front?」

「A united front?」

「Yes. Let’s cooperate with each other in regard to Yuu-kun.」

「I see.」

「But in return, stop stealing march on me like you did earlier, okay?」

「I, I get it, I’m sorry, okay? From now on, I’ll ask you to join us in such a case, Youko.」

「Likewise.」

「Yes.」

The two returned to their own classroom as they talked amicably in such a manner.

# Chapter 80 - Sairei Student Council’s Visitation! (1) -Visitors-

Saturday, the day after the June school event, the inter-class ball game competition – moreover this year, for the first time, all boys participated in the event – had ended without incident.

After the classes, which were only held half a day, were over, Sairyou Academy welcomed the after-school period as usual, but the school building was willed with giddy buzz, perhaps feeling a sense of liberation as the weekend was upon them.

However, the state of the student council office was the complete opposite, as they were about to welcome a moment of tension.

「T, they’re here!」

The one who shouted so as she violently opened the door with a bang was the second-year student serving as treasurer and secretary, Ishikawa Eimi.

Under normal circumstances, Hanmura Riko, the vice president, would have rebuked such ill-mannerism, but she merely sighed heavily as if to say that what was to come had arrived.

The student council president, Komatsu Sayaka, stood up and looked out the window.

Close to entering the rainy season, the sky was gloomy and cloudy, looking as if it would start raining at any given moment.

She could not see it from the window of the student council office since the school building was blocking the view, but two blackened luxury sedans had already been parked in the visitor parking space near the entrance to the administration building.

And Eimi had ascertained that girls in school uniforms had gotten off one after another from the rear doors, which were opened by the black-suited chauffeurs, and headed in their direction.

Likewise, Riko stood beside her and looked out.

「What about the welcoming?」

「Their president has been here before, so…」

「I see.」

「At least it will let them know that they are not welcome here.」

「Fufufu. You sure are stubborn, aren’t you, Sayaka?」

「I mean, you get it, don’t you?!」

「Yeah. I know. They should be aware that they are uninvited guests, yet they came nonetheless.」

Watching the two from behind with an anxious expression on her face was Eimi.

「As expected… Are they influential people? Umm… The people in the student council of Sairei Academy, I mean.」

Riko turned around and shook her head.

「No. I believe they are just regular high school students like us. Some of them seem to be a part of high society or have some biased ideology, though. It has been ten years since a friction occurred due to the coeducation-related matter, and although as sister schools, we have distanced ourselves from each other a little, we have a very normal relationship. It is just that, the problem is when boys are involved…」

Riko, the vice president that was originally in charge of public relations, had met them last year.

Sayaka, the president, also seemed to have a personal acquaintance among them, but right now, she continued to maintain her silence.

The two’s gazes were pointed in the direction of the waiting room.

At that moment, Yuu was in the waiting room.

Having heard that the student council of the sister school, Sairei Academy, was coming today, he was interested in them, but at the request of Sayaka and Riko, it had been decided that he would only listen to the talk from the waiting room.

Apparently, they did not want to let them meet Yuu.

This, too, was probably due to the unsavory rumors he had heard before about the student council of Sairei Academy.

A few minutes later, a calm and mature female voice could be heard, but it seemed that she was not a member of the student council, but someone who had come to inform them that they would be arriving shortly.

Upon hearing this, Sayaka and the others, however, did not go outside but waited in the student council office.

After a few more minutes passed, they could hear the voices of several girls drawing closer, exchanging words in a whisper all the while.

「Good day. It has been a while, isn’t it, Sayaka-san?」

「Mm.」

「Still… For you to not even welcome us even though we had taken the trouble to send a herald, how rude of you. Do the people of Sairyou not know what etiquette is?」

「It is your side that has come uninvited even though it would have been fine even if you didn’t come, no?」

Yuu, who was in the waiting room, could hear the sound of footsteps as people came in one after another.

They were about 5 or 6 in number.

The one who made snide remarks in a somewhat high-pitched voice was a member of the student council of Sairei Academy who had come to visit, and the one who responded in a low voice was Sayaka. Maybe she was her personal acquaintance?

Before their side could give them permission to sit down, he could hear the sound of chairs being pulled out without permission.

They certainly seem like pushy people; Yuu thought as he listened from his hiding place.

「Are there only the three of you?」

「Yeah, a certain situation arose last winter and two members ended up quitting, you see. Since then, the three of us have been managing somehow.」

「Hmm? But according to what we heard…」

「Anyway! Let’s get on with the talk at once!」

As things stood, they probably already knew about Yuu, but Riko seemed to have cut off her words of suspicion.

First of all, Sairyou’s side completed a brief self-introduction.

Next was Sairei’s side.

「I am the one serving as the student council president of Sairei Academy High School, Mitsuse Rinne. Nice to meet you. Though, I have met Sayaka-san many times before, and… the vice-president, Hanmura-san? We have met once, have we not?」

「Yes, we have.」

She spoke in a kind of noble daughter-like manner.

It was the first time for Yuu to hear that manner of speaking in real life, not in fiction.

「Ni hao. I am the vice president, Li Weifei, a third-year student. Nice to meet you.」

「Hello-. I’m Oomori Norika, also vice president. Thank you for having me today-.」

One of the vice presidents seemed to be of Chinese descent, judging from her greeting and name. The other one had a somewhat slow manner of speaking.

The treasurer and secretary, who introduced themselves after the president and vice-president, gave off a very ordinary impression.

The president and vice president seemed to be in their third year, and the treasurer and secretary in their second year.

Just as Yuu thought that was the end of it, 「Actually, she is still a first-year, but there is a student who is helping us as a candidate for the next student council officer. It is a great opportunity, so I have brought her along.」

She must have been prompted to do so.

Along with a rattling sound, the sound of someone getting up from their seat could be heard.

「Hello, my name is Kate Grimwood. Please take care of me.」

She introduced herself in English in a clear voice, followed by some words in broken Japanese.

A foreigner who was studying abroad… no, if she was a candidate for the next officer of the student council, maybe she was a foreigner who was naturalized not too long ago.

However, when Yuu replaced the name that he had heard, 『Kate Grimwood』, with the alphabet in his mind, he felt that he had seen it before.

He believed that was…

「There is another member, a boy, in your student council, is there not?」

Just as the self-introductions seemed to be over, someone from Seirei seemed to speak her mind.

「Huh… No, he’s… umm, he’s just someone we’re employing as a temporary helper.」

「No way that is true. From what we have heard, he has been actively participating in meetings for boys-girls exchange events.」

「Just who in the world have you heard such a thing from…」

True enough, Yuu joined the student council mid-April, and since May he had been showing up at meetings with the club representatives and meetings with the event executive committee.

Ever since they knew that Yuu would be participating, the participation rate had gone up bizarrely, which made Sayaka and the others smile wryly.

As they were by no means keeping it a secret, it was not surprising that one of them had leaked the information outside the school.

In the student council office, Sayaka and Riko were still trying to cover it up somehow.

However, if the other party was already aware of Yuu, there should be no need to hide.

As far as Yuu was concerned, he didn’t wish to put Sayaka and the others in a tough spot.

Standing up, Yuu opened the door and burst into the place where everyone had gathered.

「I’m sorry! For being late.」

「Ah!」

「Huh?」

「Yuu-kun!」

While everyone there was stunned, the one who waved her hand happily was Eimi.

Unlike usual, the long desks had been arranged horizontally into two rows, and on the back side, Sayaka, Riko and Eimi were sitting side by side in that order.

The six girls on the front side, three girls per long desk, must be the student council of Sairei.

Their uniform was similar in design to that of the current summer uniform of Sairyou Academy, which was a white sailor uniform with light purple lines and pink ribbons, and a light purple skirt.

However, it was a one-piece type with the top and bottom integrated, and its distinctive features were its purple lines, which were darker than Sairyou’s, and red ribbon.

「Dear me, the report that was supposed to be submitted by the end of the day took a surprisingly long time… It has only just started, right? Err, nice to meet you. It hasn’t been long since I entered this school, but I have been given the honor to assist everyone as a member of the student council since April, the name is Hirose Yuu. I look forward to working with you!」

「Oh, my!」

At the same time as Yuu bowed his head in salutation, the one who suddenly stood up was the girl on the far left.

Coming directly in front of him, she was tall, about the same height as Yuu.

Her long hair, which almost reached her back, was a gentle copper beige with reddish tints, and was wavy and fluffy from the middle, but the parts that hung forward from her shoulders were in ringlet curls.

Her eyes, which were staring at Yuu, were large and bright and had double eyelids, and her lips, on which was putting her hand, were glossy with pink rogue.

Partly because she was wearing a lot of make-up, she gave off sexiness that was not typical of a high school student.

On top of that, her tight-fitting one-piece school uniform accentuated the contrast between her large, bulging breasts and round buttocks and her slim waist.

If she were to change into a suit and tight skirt instead of her school uniform, she would probably look right at home as an office lady strolling through a 21st century office district.

Looking at Yuu’s body from top to bottom as if she was licking it, she suddenly moved very close to him, reached out her fingers covered with colorful lamé nail polish and took his chin.

「Hmm-… Quite the good find, is it not? Let’s take him home.」

「Huh?」

Just as he was at a loss for an answer after having such words said to him, her hand was flicked away with a speed unperceivable to the eyes.

「Ow!」

「Yuu-kun, this way.」

Being pulled by the hand of Sayaka, who had come to his side before he noticed it, Yuu went around to the long desks at the front.

As they brought out a spare pipe chair and opened some space between their seats, it was decided that he would sit between Sayaka and Riko, as if being guarded by the two.

「They are the student council of Sairei, the president Mitsuse Rinne-san, the vice president Li Weifei-san and Oomori Norika-san, and then…」

Before the members of the student council of Sairei Academy who were facing them could interject, Riko introduced them in rapid succession.

「Lastly, first-year student Kate Grimwood-san… Right?」

「Yes.」

While everyone else from the student council of Sairei was staring fixedly at Yuu, for some reason, she alone was hanging her head, making her long blonde hair hang down, so he couldn’t see her face.

「Umm, can you show me your face, please?」

「Uh…」

When Yuu nonchalantly said so, she choked on her words.

As if having no other choice, she raised her face and brushed away her hair a little with her fingertips, but although he could now see one of her eyes, she continued to look away from him.

Sporting a somewhat oval face, she had sharp eyes and well-defined features.

They said it was difficult to distinguish a foreigner’s face, but if she was such a beauty, there was no way you would be able to forget her, as expected.

In his mind, Yuu tried to make her wear a red jersey instead of her school uniform.

「Ah! It’s you, Keiko-san!」

「「「Huh?」」」

「Keiko? Not Kate (Keito)?」

「Yuu-kun, do you know her?」

「Well, it was brief, but I’ve met her before… Hahaha.」

Before the talk could begin, the room was enveloped in a bit of mayhem.

---

「As such, when I was at the threat of getting tangled up with some ill-natured delinquents, she and her friends gave me a helping hand.」

「I see.」

「Heh-」

「How unusual. To think Kate would interact with a boy on her own accord.」

「No, that time, my comrades just arbitrarily…」

He referred to the day when he went out to the town on his own.

In the middle of it, the fact that he was cross-dressing was found out, and after being chased by a group of women, he was taken to a coffee shop on a back street that was the hideout of the Red Scorpions, where he mingled with four delinquent girls.

The blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl in a jersey who called herself Keiko alone did not join them, but she gave him a ride home on her bike.

As far as Yuu was concerned, there was no way he could tell them the whole truth, so he told them the story of when they met while dramatizing the points that were fairly safe.

And she did nothing but nod her head, hardly interjecting.

「When we were about to part ways, I remember you saying that your name was Kurimori Keiko, though-」

「Ah-… T, that was, umm… Yes! It was embarrassing, so I gave you a false name…」

「I see. Then your real name is Kate, right? It certainly suits you better.」

As Yuu stared at her, Keiko, or Kate, nodded her head in a begrudging manner.

「Still, Kate… You are actually able to speak Japanese fluently, are you not? When did you become so skilled in Japanese?」

「No… That is, not true.」

「No need to go back to your broken Japanese at this point.」

「Yes.」

Maybe partly because the other party was an upperclassman from the same school, Kate showed an attitude like that of a borrowed cat, giving off an impression that was a little different from when he met her at the Red Scorpions hideout.

However, her attitude as she looked away in a prickly manner when Yuu, who was happy to meet her again, looked at her with a smile was the same as the one he saw on that day.

「We ended up side-tracking, but first of all, our side will go ahead and present our proposal, which is the purpose of our visit today. To re-establish the exchange events between the two schools…」

「We refuse.」

Sporting hair that was cut short in a techno-cut style and combed down neatly into a seven-three.

A skinny figure where no bulge could be seen from over her uniform at all. The tallest one among the six girls on the other side.

And then narrow eyes that gave her a fox-like appearance, that was the vice president of Sairei named Li Weifei.

Since a while ago, she had shown no smiles at all and her tone of voice was curt.

She was proficient in Japanese, but as she spoke, she seemed to have a little accent.

Riko, this side’s vice president, also gave off a sagacious impression when Yuu first met her, but the vice president of Sairei gave off an even more inhuman coldness that reminded him of a machine.

In fact, her not changing her facial expression at all even when she looked at Yuu was proof of this.

And Riko had dismissed the words of that Weifei without letting her finish.

Both vice presidents glared at each other with cold eyes.

From Yuu’s point of view, rather than sparks flying about, it was more like a blizzard was blowing over the place.

「Oh my, so scary-.」

The one who cut in in a teasing manner while brushing up her hair was the other vice president, Norika.

In contrast to Weifei, she had long, straight black hair that was cut to a certain, uniform length. Her bangs were thinly scattered and curled, making her forehead visible. She had a flamboyant facial feature with thick makeup that seemed to highlight her large eyes and mouth even more.

To Yuu, she was someone that reminded him of the women with uniform-length hair and tight-fitting clothes who flocked to the dancing platforms at discos during the bubble era.

「Hah.」

The one who exhaled in a mocking manner was the president of Sairei, Rinne.

「Is there something funny?」

This time, it was the two presidents who glared at each other.

「The re-establishment of the exchange events between the two schools is something that has already been decided by the board of directors. Do you really think that the student council can reject it on its own discretion? Well… If you persist in your stubbornness in spite of that and don’t mind if the budget is reduced for the next school year onward, then…」

「…」

As a matter of fact, both Sayaka and Riko knew that it would be difficult to refuse.

Even so, it would be impudent of them to go along with the wishes of the Sairei’s side from the beginning, so they decided to express their refusal to their face.

「You say re-establishing the exchange event, but… how had it been done in the past?」

The one who broke the mood that had begun to turn stormy was Eimi.

「According to the documents that were left behind on our side, it appears that the main points were interactions between clubs. Joint practices and friendly matches for athletic clubs, joint presentations for cultural clubs, etc. Of course, there were also elaborate events for the general students, such as karuta (Japanese playing cards) tournaments and amateur singing contests, depending on the year.」

「Heh-」

The secretary from the other side explained while opening a file containing thick materials.

Unlike the president and vice presidents, who had strong characters, the treasurer and secretary, both of whom had similar semi-long hair, could probably be classified as refined beautiful girls among ordinary high school girls, but compared to those three, they inevitably gave off a plain impression.

_Clap_ It was Rinne, the student council president of Sairei, who clapped her hands there.

「It is just that, it would be no fun to do the same thing we did 10 years ago. As such, we will gather talented high school students not only from the two schools but also from other schools in the prefecture and hold a glorious art exhibition, a luxurious and gorgeous art festival! It will surely turn into an event that will go down in history!」

With sparkling eyes, Rinne waved her hands in the air like a conductor and emphasized her points, but for some reason, the other members of the student council seemed to show no enthusiasm at the idea.

Did that mean it was something that she alone wanted to do personally?

Riko leaned in and whispered to Yuu, who had no leeway to interject and had been doing nothing but listening to the talk.

「The Nikko Group is a large business alliance centered around Nikko Automobile, one of Japan’s leading automobile manufacturers. It was originally a zaibatsu company founded by a former noble family, and she is a direct descendant of the founding family. In the automobile industry, it is a competitor of Sayaka’s company. On top of that, Nikko is actively engaging in cooperative activities with famous orchestras, theater troupes, theaters, etc., so she herself is also famous for her deep knowledge of music and theater.」

「I, I see.」

In the past, the nobility also had the duty of protecting the arts, and it seemed that even now, her family still had such a tendency.

Which meant, she was the perfect person to be the student council president of Sairei Academy, where half of the students belonged to the art course.

「Now then, let’s put aside the dreamy ramblings of our president.」

「You are right. Let’s talk about something more realistic.」

「H, how cruel!」

Shocked by the cold words of her friends, Rinne went _kiiiiii_ as she bit her handkerchief.

The person in question might have been serious about it, but from Yuu’s point of view, it looked like a comedy skit.

「When we discussed it among ourselves, we came to the conclusion that it would probably be more interesting if the two schools competed with each other rather than simply interacting.」

Instead of Rinne, who was still mumbling about arts being this and that, the one who proceeded with the talk was the vice president Weifei.

「By competing, do you mean like an inter-school competition?」

「That’s right.」

「Even if you say competing with each other…」

The response from the Sairyou side was weak.

To begin with, as a co-ed school, they were already putting a lot of effort into their boys-girls exchange events, so the main reason was probably because they didn’t want to add even more extra work.

However, it seemed that the vice president Weifei had anticipated this.

Crooking her lips up, she was probably intending to show a mile, but her eyes remained narrowed, so it looked a little scary.

「Since we are taking the trouble to turn it into an inter-school competition, I believe there should be benefit for the winner.」

「Well, that is true, but…」

「I want you to listen to the idea we have come up with. If Sairyou Academy wins, we will give your clubs permission to use Sairei Academy’s facilities.」

「「「Huh?-」」」

The three members of the student council of Sairyou let out a surprised cry at the same time.

「Is such a thing possible?」

「Of course, there will be a need to adjust the period, time, and scope of use, but it is a fact that we have some leeway in terms of P.E.-related facilities, so I believe there will be no problem.」

「I mean-, compared to our cultural clubs, the athletic clubs in our school aren’t very active, after all. It’s on the level that there are even some clubs that are only in name, but are actually inactive, you know-. It’s only when the student council inspects them or when there is a tournament that they gather their club members in a hurry and try to cover it up, after all-.」

The person in question is probably intending to say it in a serious manner, but because of her slow manner of speech and strange wiggly body language, it ended up sounding like it was no big deal.

Compared to public schools, Sairyou Academy was better off in terms of facilities, but as a school with thriving athletic clubs, it would be desirable to have more sports facilities available for use.

To cite an example, their baseball, softball, soccer, track, and rugby clubs were using the three fields in turn.

The first and second fields, which were located within the school grounds, were one thing, but there were some clubs that were unable to use the third field due to facility-related matters.

Even if it took time to travel to Sairei Academy, which was located in the neighboring city, the advantage of being able to secure a large practice space was great.

「The offer itself is attractive, so I believe there is room for consideration. Now then, on the other hand, if Sairei wins, what would the benefit be?」

「Of course, it is to invite the boys to come to our school. There is nothing else but it.」

Weifei said as if it was only a matter of course.

They must have already anticipated that matter.

The expressions on the faces of Sayaka, Riko and Eimi hardened.

# Chapter 81 - Sairei Student Council’s Visitation! (2) -Let’s do our best-

The first thing that began was a strong rejection from the Sairyou side, who were adamant that they could not comply.

Facing it, the Sairei side didn’t yield either.

According to them, it was not right that Sairyou alone got to monopolize the boys just because it was a co-ed school. Since they were sister schools, there should be no harm in re-establishing the exchange events like they used to do and give their students the opportunity to come into contact with boys, too.

From the point of view of the Sairyou side, they were pushing their demand with a self-serving and forceful logic.

The heated argument, or rather fierce exchange continued, but the one that put a damper on it was a single remark from Kate, who had remained quiet the whole time.

「The boy over there, as a boy, what do you think about it?」

With her blue eyes, she directed a stern, cold gaze toward Yuu.

「Hmm-」

As the only boy in this room, Yuu was like the representative of the boys.

With that in mind, Yuu couldn’t help but fall into thought.

All-girls high school, it was a girl’s garden.

As a man with the values of his former world, it was a place that he would love to visit by all means.

However, he knew that he was the only boy in this world who would have such a thought.

The sense of the general boys was different from Yuu’s.

In contrast to girls that were overwhelmingly more numerous than them, boys, the minority, were as timid as herbivores.

「Well, you say inviting boys to your school, but given the current situation, I think there would be little to no boys who would want to go.」

「Huh? I, I mean, you regularly hold boys-girls social events at Sairyou, do you not? In that case, letting them come to our school from time to time should also be…」

「That is only possible because Sairyou has been doing a lot of trial and error for the past 10 years since it became a co-ed school.」

Yuu knew from asking Sayaka and others.

About how the seniors had been thinking and executing the events with consideration for the boys up until now.

He emphasized this point.

「It hasn’t been long since I joined the student council, but I have seen with my own eyes how much attention has been paid not only by the student council, but also by our female seniors and classmates. It is absurd to suddenly want to be close with boys while ignoring the accumulation of such daily experiences.」

「「「Yuu-kun!」」」

Starting with Sayaka, the three members of the Sairyou student council looked at Yuu with sparkling eyes, so he felt self-conscious.

Hearing this, each and every member of the Sairei student council ended up falling silent, but it was Rinne, the student council president, who suddenly stood up with a bam.

「If that’s the case! If we appeal to the boys of Sairyou for the magnificence of art, which is the characteristic of our school!」

There she goes again… The vice presidents and the rest of the members showed a look of exasperation, but surprisingly, it was Yuu who expressed his approval.

「Hmm. That is… Perhaps, it may work.」

「「「「Huh… Huuuuuuh---!!!」」」」

Looking closely, even Rinne, the person in question, was taken aback by his response.

「Actually, there are quite a few boys who are interested in the arts and cultural activities, you see.」

What came to Yuu’s mind was Masaya, who had taken piano lessons since he was a child and was now a member of the concert band club.

And Rei, who had an interest in and had taken up flower arrangement and tea ceremony as lessons.

Other than them, a lot of their classmates had also joined cultural clubs after entering high school.

「Unlike our school, Sairei is a school specialized in arts and culture, right? In that case, if you can not only make a good display of that point and arouse their interest but also guarantee their safety, maybe there will a few boys who will think it should be okay to go and take a look.」

「Oh, my! How wonderful!」

Sporting a radiant smile on her face, Rinne suddenly exposed her thighs and climbed over the desk, then dashed over to Yuu and grabbed his hand.

As her long copper-beige hair swayed softly, the scent of floral perfume tickled his nostrils.

「How about it? Boy, care to have dinner at our place tonight?」

「No touching.」

「O, ouch. Sheesh…」

The one who slapped Rinne’s wrist with a sharp sound and forcefully released him from her grasp was Riko.

---

At any rate, as a tentative proposal, if Sairyou won, they would be given certain rights to use the facilities that Sairei had (especially those related to physical education). If Sairei won, they would be given the opportunity to make an appeal and invite the boys to watch their regular summer recital. As for how many of them would actually come, it all depended on their appeal.

They settled with that. The detailed adjustments were to be discussed on a later date.

The next question was what kind of inter-school competition they would be having, and the meeting turned stormy once again.

While the Sairyou side endorsed a match format for athletic clubs, the Sairei side insisted on a presentation format for cultural clubs.

In that case, why not have all the clubs compete? With that, they were about to come to a consensus, but then a question arose as to how they would decide on the winner of the cultural clubs’ presentations.

There, Sairei said that they could just call an expert in that field, but Sairyou was against it, saying that if it was an expert that had a connection with Sairei, there would be a problem with fairness.

Seeing that the discussion remained heated and showed no sign that it would come to a conclusion anytime soon, Yuu pulled his chair back and stood up.

「I will go make some tea.」

As he went around the desk…

「Let me help you.」

Kate, who had not joined the discussion, stood up as well.

「Ah, thank you. It’s this way.」

Kate was unwilling to make eye contact with him, but feeling happy to hear that offer from her, Yuu invited her to the office kitchenette.

「Thank you for earlier.」

「Huh? Aah.」

While they were waiting for the kettle to boil, Kate, who was standing behind him, said in a quiet voice that Yuu could barely hear.

She was probably talking about how he had deceived them using a made up story about his meeting with Kate without mentioning the Red Scorpions.

「Likewise, I couldn’t really tell them the truth either, after all. So we’re in the same boat.」

「Hmph. I guess so.」

「Still… I sure was surprised there. To think you would be in the student council of Sairei.」

When Yuu turned and looked at her, Kate looked away.

「So was I, I had never thought that you’d be in the student council.」

「Hahaha. Well, one thing led to another, you see.」

When the kettle was about to boil, he took the teacups and teapot out of the drawer, but then Kate came next to him and helped him.

「You seem pretty used to it.」

「I’m a first year student, after all. To being with, we don’t have that many people, after all.」

「Hmph. How should I put it, you’re quite the strange one, aren’t you?」

「Yeah, I get that a lot.」

Scratching his head, Yuu looked at Kate standing next to him.

Both of them had blonder hair, but unlike Sera’s near-white color, Kate’s was a gorgeous color that could exactly be referred to as golden blonde.

Her long hair, which reached the middle of her back, appeared to be straight at a glance, but the ends were a little quirky and had a gentle wave to them.

Her height was not much different from Yuu’s, and compared to the red jersey he saw the other day, the one-piece uniform showed her figure that boasted strong self-assertion better, and whether he liked it or not, his eyes ended up getting drawn toward her.

「What is it?」

Perhaps noticing his gaze, she stared back at him.

「No, I just think you have beautiful hair. Besides, you look good in your school uniform.」

「Haa… To be able to openly say such a thing in front of the person in question without getting embarrassed, you’re just like a womanizer. Even though you have the same name… No, it’s nothing.」

「Same name…? Rather, unlike before, you talk to me normally today, don’t you?」

「Wha…! It, it’s not like I want to get close with boys or anything, alright?!」

Just as he thought he was able to talk to her somewhat normally, sure enough, she was none other than the prickly Kate.

As expected, the fact that she hated men seemed to not have changed.

From Yuu’s point of view, he thought she was quite the strange one herself, and coupled with her beauty, she was a person in whom he couldn’t help but be interested.

When he returned with a tray with enough cups for everyone, it seemed that they still hadn’t decided on the competition.

Having been clashing arguments for an hour, they seemed to be thirsty, so when Yuu and Kate brought them tea, they appreciated it.

As they distributed the yokan (sweet bean jelly) that they had bought for tea snack, cut up and put on small plates, the meeting went into a break.

From what he heard from Riko and Eimi about the discussion while they were leaving their seats, it appeared that since they ended up being in parallel lines for the club competition, both sides had proposed different ideas.

Mixed martial arts, giant domino toppling, beauty contest (cosplay allowed), karuta tournament, karaoke contest… etc.

There were many ideas, but it seemed that they had not decided on any specific one.

There, Yuu asked Sayaka and Rinne for their requirements and wrote them down on the white board for the purpose of organizing them.

It has to be something that is easy for many students to participate in.

It has to be something that doesn’t lean toward a certain school’s specialty.

It has to be something whose outcome can be decided on an individual or group basis.

In order to allow the boys to participate, the school yard and gymnasium of Sairyou will be used.

The budget will be provided by both schools, but ultimately, it has to be within the scope of a student event.

The date of the event will be after the final exam in July. Preferably after the summer vacation.

He also wrote down the ideas that had been proposed so far.

As far as Yuu was concerned, he thought a beauty contest (cosplay allowed) would be interesting, but in that case, there was the question as to what position the boys would be assuming.

Would they serve as judges or would they participate, too?

As Yuu was lost in thought while rereading the points he had written on the whiteboard, he sensed strong gazes on him.

Including Rinne and Sayaka who were drinking tea in a proper manner with their backs straight, most of the student council members of both schools were staring at Yuu.

Only Kate, who was sitting at the far end of the desk, was eating the yokan bit by bit, which looked strangely picturesque despite her Western appearance.

「Don’t you think mixed martial arts would be a good idea?」

「As expected, it has to be beauty content!」

Sayaka and Rinne’s voices overlapped, and they glared at each other.

「How barbaric.」

「In a beauty contest, will the boys serve as judges? If so, I believe that would give Sairyou an advantage.」

「Guh…」

It was you two who proposed those, huh. So Yuu thought inwardly.

Perhaps in part because this time, the talk had been forcefully imposed on them, for today only, the normally calm Sayaka had insisted on such a reckless idea.

「Do you have any good ideas, Yuu-kun?」

As Eimi asked him so with a smile full of expectation, Yuu pondered again.

A competition between high schools.

Something that would allow as many students as possible to participate regardless of their strong and weak points…

An idea emerged from Yuu’s memories before his rebirth.

「How about… a quiz?」

「「「「「 Quiz?!」」」」」

「Err, let’s see… Participants will be paired in groups of three, and the first round will be a yes-no type of two choices preliminary match. In the main round, they will compete in blocks consisting of several groups, and the groups that take first place will advance to the final round. From the main round, I think we can also make the quiz more elaborate, such as a three-choice quiz, a quick-push quiz, or a one-minute time limit quiz.」

What came to Yuu’s mind was the 『National High School Quiz Championship』, the so-called high school quiz that was held every summer and that he used to watch on TV for a period of time.

「What about the quiz questions?」

「I think we can collect public submissions at each school, and then the other school will review them and screen them to see whether or not they are appropriate as quiz questions. If possible, it will be desirable to have a variety of genres, such as science, politics, history, sports, entertainment, culture, trivia, and so on. We will shuffle them together before the event and then pick the questions at random.」

「I see-」

「Hmm. It might be a good idea.」

The response from the Sairei side was also very positive. The vice president Weifei might have raised the corners of her mouth to show a smile, but she looked like a predator aiming for its prey, so it was a little scary.

---

The discussion continued after that too, but result-wise, the quiz proposed by Yuu was adopted and their plan from then on was set.

Tentatively, the plan would be implemented on July 27.

Until then, they would discuss things like schedule by phone and fax, and another meeting would be held on a Saturday afternoon in July, so they had decided.

Since Sairyou had a larger student body, it was decided that they would hold an intramural preliminary match in advance, and on the day of the event, 100 groups, 300 students in total, would be participating in the competition.

Of course, it was decided that the boys from Sairyou would be participating in it, too.

Before they knew it, two hours had passed since the meeting started.

Though, compared to the first half of the meeting, it felt like the second half, which lasted less than an hour with a break in between, had ended in a lighter and smoother manner.

Even though at first the Sairyou side had leaned heavily toward opposing the idea, as they judged that if they were going to do it, they had no choice but to tackle the issue seriously, they eventually began to actively exchange opinions with the other party.

When the meeting was over, the student council of Sairyou also decided to send them off until the front of the boarding house.

「Well then, I suppose this is where part.」

「Yes. We spent a meaningful time today. Now then, everyone of Sairyou, have a good day.」

_Squish_ Soft bulges were pressed against Yuu’s arms.

Feel-wise, the ones on the left side were equally matched with Sayaka’s, while the ones on the right side boasted even larger bulges.

「You there, wait.」

「Could you please refrain from trying to take him home so casually?」

「Don’t take Yuu-kun away!」

Rinne on his left side and the vice president Norika on his right, the two were holding Yuu’s arms firmly.

「Oh my? I have taken a liking to his looks and personality, so I am thinking about getting to know him better, you see.」

「I can’t allow that.」

Sayaka came at them with a scary look on her face, so as expected, Rinne and Norika moved away from Yuu.

「Oh, my, so scary. We are only joking.」

「It doesn’t sound like a joke when you guys do it.」

「Now, what might you be talking about?」

Rinne, who tilted her head as if she truly didn’t know what she was talking about, turned around, smiled, and squeezed Yuu’s hand once again.

「I am looking forward to seeing you again. Yuu-san.」

「Well, please go easy on me.」

As they watched the members of the student council of Sairei leave toward the administration building where their cars were parked, Sayaka’s group of three showed an exhausted smile with a face as if they were feeling relieved from the bottom of their heart.

---

As when they came, the members of Sairei student council rode separately in the two cars, and in the car in which the president and the vice presidents were riding, Rinne was thinking about something with a cold look in her eyes, a complete change from the goofy expression she had had on her face until just a moment ago.

「Norika.」

「Yes-」

「When we get back, I need you to contact the 『Agent』 immediately.」

「About that boy from earlier, right-」

「By all means, I would like to get my hands on that boy.」

Rinne raised her right hand and looked at her manicured nails, but it seemed that in her mind, she was recalling the feeling of the body she had touched earlier.

「From touching his body, he seems to be training his body quite a bit.」

「He was wearing tight jeans, so I could clearly see the bulge on his crotch. I’m sure he is hiding something nice down there. Gufufu.」

「Ufufu. I wonder what kind of voice he will make on the bed?」

_Kukuku_ With a laugh, Rinne gracefully crossed her legs.

Then she schooled her loosened up lips and turned to Norika.

「Not only his address, family structure, and parent’s place of employment, but also his hobbies, preferences, and even his dating history, strip everything bare. You get it, do you not?」

「But of course-.」

Norika’s tone of voice was as slow and lax as before, but her eyes were not smiling.

It was just that, one of them, Weifei alone was looking out the window, acting as if it had nothing to do with her.

---

Yuu and the others returned to the student council office and took their seats, but Sayaka and Riko’s complexions were not so great.

「As things stand, July will be a very busy month for us, and yet…」

「Haa-, talk about depressing.」

「Come to think of it, what’s the event in July?」

「The intramural camp. Last year it was held at the end of July, I believe.」

At Sairyou Academy, excluding the new students orienteering event and school trips, there were few events in which the students went outside the school.

This was also part of the consideration for the boys, and for safety reasons, most events were held inside the school.

They also deliberately held the camping in the school grounds, rather than at a campsite on a mountain stream.

Setting aside its location, with boys and girls cooking together in the boarding house’s kitchen and gathering around the campfire, it sounded like a pretty fun event.

「In that case, how about we hold it on the same day?」

「On the same day?」

At Yuu’s words, Sayaka and Riko fell into thought

「The preparation will still be tough, and on the day of the event, we will be working from morning to night, so the workload will be greater, but conversely, we will only have to be do the cleanup once.」

「That is fine and all, but… I think it would be a big problem if Sairei finds out about it.」

「To avoid that, I guess we’ll have to be very strict and thorough in keeping it a secret.」

「All that is left is to set on a time and make sure to have them all leave by then.」

For the time being, they decided to discuss and decide whether or not to hold the July boys-girls social event on the same day as the inter-school competition with Sairei.

「Phew. Either way, I am truly glad that you were here with us today, Yuu-kun. We wouldn’t have been able to come to an agreement on our own.」

「Fufufu. You are right. I am truly glad to have you here with us, Yuu-kun.」

Sayaka and Riko, who were sitting on his left and right sides as they had been during the meeting, leaned in close to him.

「Yuu-kun!」

Hugging him from behind was Eimi.

Yuu took the tassel of her twin-tail hair, which hung down to his chest, in his hand and played with it.

「I’m glad I could be of help. But still, they were pretty intense people, or rather…」

「I think they were still playing the nice guys today.」

「Is, is that so? Them acting like that…」

「Yes.」

Sayaka, who had been resting her cheek on Yuu’s shoulder, raised her face, so they looked at each other.

Her expression showed that she was seriously worried.

「If it is our students, there is no need to worry no matter how close you get with them, Yuu-kun. We have been educated under the motto, 『Be a lady to the boys』, since the very first day we entered this school, after all.」

「Ah… True enough.」

Whenever they met, the girls from Sairyou were always full of smiles and amiable.

Although they showed their favorability toward Yuu and the other boys, they never forcefully approached them and always properly maintained a certain distance from them.

That was why, even first-year boys who were not used to girls were not so afraid of them, and they were able to gradually get closer with each other. These all were apparently the result of education as a co-ed school.

「However, Sairei is different. They hold no respect toward boys. That’s why… If we re-establish the exchange event, I feel like it will cause various problems, which makes me scared.」

Riko held Yuu’s arm tight in her arms.

「Riko-senpai…」

「In fact, their student council president was clearly targeting you, Yuu-kun!」

Even as she expressed her anger, Eimi was stroking Yuu’s head with her mouth loosened up.

「Given her standing, I don’t think Rinne will go as far as committing a crime, but there are rumors that she switches men one after another, after all. I’m afraid that if she targets you, she will come on to you relentlessly, Yuu-kun.」

Sayaka had a worried look on her face, but with the three of them sticking so closely to him, on the contrary, Yuu was slowly getting turned on by their sweet scents and warmth.

「Things have ended up turning like this, so I have no choice but to brace myself. Besides, I have the three of you here with me, so I don’t feel helpless at all.」

「「「Yuu-kun.」」」

「Today, the meeting dragged on, so you must be tired, right? How about we relax in the waiting room?」

「Are you okay… with time?」

Riko’s cheeks turned a little pink when she heard him mentioning the waiting room, and when she asked him so with upturned eyes, it was so adorable that he couldn’t help but break into a smile.

Taking a look at the clock in the room, Yuu nodded his head.

「It’s still fine. That’s why…」

With the three of them sticking closely to him, Yuu slowly stood up.

When he kissed them in turn starting with Sayaka, the girls pressed themselves even more closely against Yuu.

Bunched up together exactly like dango, the four of them moved to the waiting room.

# Chapter 82 - Sairei Student Council’s Visitation! (3) -LOVE LOVE LOVE-

「Hmm-, no matter how many times I look at it, Yuu-kun’s dick is so manly that I get wet just from holding and licking it like this! Amm… Chuupa, lick, chuu-」

「Ufufufu, it is so firm and pulsating. Moreover… haa-, it is so hot… nmm, chuu, chuu, lick.」

In front of Yuu’s eyes, Riko and Eimi were caressing his erect penis from both sides with their hands and mouths.

Presently, Yuu had already had his panties and underpants taken off by them.

Eimi was not only sucking the glans into her mouth, but also moving her tongue around in her mouth and licking it around.

Her hand was stroking Yuu’s stomach around while her other hand was gently massaging the ball sack.

Riko was crawling her lips and tongue over the pole as she stroked from the base.

Eimi had the upper hand in terms of aggressiveness in giving fellatio.

At first, Riko displayed no semblance of technique at all, but perhaps thanks to her showing her inherent earnestness, she had improved quite a lot.

Both of them loving Yuu’s penis was probably the secret of their improvement.

On the other hand, Yuu was delightfully sucking and fondling Sayaka’s breasts as she hugged him from the side.

Boasting enchanting size and shape, her beautiful breasts were such well-shaped breasts that he would love to fondle and suck all the time.

When Yuu was alone with Sayaka in the student council office, there were times when he ended up rubbing them from over her school uniform as they hugged each other.

At those moments, she would simply chide him a little at first, but when his fondling hands reached for her nipples, she tended to let out sweet cries, so her sensitivity was also great.

「Kuh, aaaah… Ahn! Geez… You sure like boobs, don’t you, Yuu? L, looking at you like this, you are like a big baby… hnnn, kufufu…」

「I love your boobs, after all. But it feels good to you too, doesn’t it, Sayaka?」

「U, uu… It, it feels good… Aahn!」

Sayaka held Yuu’s head against her chest lovingly.

Before they knew it, they had reached a point where when the four of them had sex, they would forgo all formalities and call each other by their given name.

Though, Eimi alone still called him in the same way she did before, as she seemed to have taken a liking to the「Yuu-kun」 call and showed no sign of wanting to change it.

Yuu rolled the nipple he was holding in his mouth with his tongue, or sandwiched it between his lips and pulled it lightly.

With his other hand, he had been fondling her breast that was so voluminous that it was more than he could hold in the palm of his hand, but he slowly slid it down.

The girls’ group had also taken off their skirts and panties already. Sayaka was in a state where she had the front of her sailor uniform open and her unhooked bra shifted upward.

As such, Yuu’s hand, which was tracing Sayaka’s toned stomach, passed through her pubic mound and reached her wet and glistening secret place very easily.

When he spread the chasm with two fingers and traced the middle area with his middle finger, his finger immediately got covered by her love juices.

When he put his fingertip into the vaginal opening, bending the first joint as he moved it, he could hear a lewd, squelching sound.

「Ahn… Aahn! T, that place… Yuu!」

「Looks like your place down there is also so wet, Sayaka.」

「I, I mean… Yu…uuu!」

With a pained look on her face, Sayaka lowered her head and pleaded Yuu to kiss her.

Standing on her knees, Sayaka was looking down on him from above, so when she lowered her head, Yuu’s face was wrapped in her black and glossy hair, which made him feel happy in its own way.

Having her sensuality stimulated by Yuu’s caresses filled with his feelings, Sayaka zealously dropped her lips.

「Nmm… Chuu… chuu, nmm… Hnn, nghh… Amm… Lick, chuupa… Haa, haa, Yuu.」

「Ahh… Sayaka.」

Yuu’s arousal level increased as he licked off Sayaka’s saliva, who had her mouth slightly open, and the movements of his finger playing with her vaginal opening increased in speed.

As he inserted his middle finger deep into her vagina and moved it around, _squelch, squelch_ the sound grew into a sticky wet one.

「Hyaan… Y, Yuu! If you move it, any more than that!」

「If I move it any more than this, what will happen, I wonder?」

「You meanie… Hnn---! Ahn, ahn! N… Nooo…」

While Yuu was teasing Sayaka, Riko, who couldn’t hold herself back any longer, was trying to get on top of him.

「Aa-n. I want Yuu-kun’s dick too…」

「Nghh. You have to wait for your turn.」

Ignoring Eimi, who was looking at her enviously, Riko excitedly straddled Yuu, spread her chasm on her own, and tried to take his penis into her.

While she was giving him a fellatio, she played with her secret with her own fingers, so she was already ready to go.

In rotation, they had decided on the order for when the three of them did it together.

Last time, although there had ended up being a blank period of more than a week due to them being busy with the preparations of the inter-class ball game competition, Sayaka was the first, so Riko was the first today.

The order was maintained: Sayaka → Riko → Eimi.

「Yuu… Nghhhh… I, I’m putting it in, okay?」

As she sandwiched his penis, which had gotten hard and was stretching along his lower abdomen, between her thighs and rubbed it with the base of her bare thighs, Riko whispered so in a sweet voice.

When Yuu temporarily turned from Sayaka to Riko, they looked at each other.

In the face of the union, Riko, who had taken off her glasses and her cheeks were tinted pink, was completely in a horny mode.

It was the face of a female, which her normally sagacious self would never show in front of other people.

「So today, you want to ride on top, huh.」

「Yes… I think I have gotten a little better at it, too. So… let’s go at it… together?」

「I love that look of yours, Riko, it’s so erotic and cute. Then, lick this first.」

「Ahan.」

What Yuu held out was his middle finger, which he had been slipping in and out of Sayaka’s vagina until just a moment ago.

Not only the base of his finger, but even the palm of his hand was coated with clear juice.

「Nmm… Lick… Amm… So tasty. Nmm, hnn, slurp, chuurp, chuurp, lick, chuupa.」

While moving her hips slowly, Riko licked Yuu’s finger zealously.

She reached out her red tongue and scooped up the droplet that dripped from his fingertip and almost fell off, and took it into her mouth.

After swallowing it as if savoring the taste of Sayaka, she kissed and sucked Yuu’s finger all over from the top and licked the base carefully.

Then she opened her mouth wide and swallowed Yuu’s finger and began to suck it as if she was giving him a fellatio.

Crazy…erotic…

The sight of a beautiful senior licking his finger in such a lewd manner was very stimulating.

There, Eimi, whose hand was free, hugged him from the right side.

「Yuu-kun!」

「Amy!」

Since they came into this room, they had exchanged kisses numerous times, in which they used the tips of their tongues from the very beginning, and twined their tongues together without minding whose tongue it was.

His left hand had been holding Sayaka’s waist, but it was now rubbing her vaginal opening from the buttocks.

Unable to endure it, Sayaka clung to Yuu and passionately showered kisses on his shoulder and neck.

「I can’t, endure it anymore!」

Yuu shifted his hips slightly to aim at Riko and placed the glans at her vaginal opening.

「Hnn, fewh? Yuu?!」

Riko, who was still sucking and licking his finger zealously even now, was surprised.

That because Yuu had actively gotten into the position for penetration.

「I mean, it’s because you’ve been teasing me, you know, Riko?」

「T, that was not my intention… Aun!」

「I want to have you right this instant, so… Guh.」

「Y, Yuu… Hnn… Aahn!」

As soon as Yuu and Riko were connected all the way to the deepest part through their joint efforts, unable to hold back the pleasure, both of them let out a cry.

「It, it came into me… Ahn, so good… it feels so good! Yuu!」

「Riko! It feels good! To make it feel even better… P, please move.」

「Yes! Y, Yuu’s dick… is poking my deepest part… Ahn, ahn, aahn! It, it feels, so good! Ahn! So good!」

Holding Yuu’s shoulders tightly, Riko shook her hips fervently.

It was on the level where each time she did, a wet squelching sound leaked from their coupling tools.

Even though she usually carried herself in an intelligent manner, right now, she was dominated by pleasure and unable to put what she was feeling into words, transforming into nothing but a female that desired a male.

Other than Riko, who got the first penis, the other two were also becoming less reserved in their desire for Yuu.

Letting out moans as she had her secret place played with once more, Sayaka sealed Yuu’s lips and showered him with passionate kisses.

Eimi was licking and sucking Yuu from his neck to his collarbone.

Yuu was also stroking around the bodies of Sayaka and Eimi, having a feel of them with his available hands.

The feast held by the four of them had only just begun.

---

When Yuu pumped a large amount of semen into Riko’s womb after she reached climax several times, she ended up collapsing.

The one who came up to him and hugged him without giving him time to check on Riko was Eimi, whose turn was next.

「Yuu-kun, hurry up, please!」

「Hahaha, I get it, okay.」

Smiling wryly at Eimi, who was pressing her body close to him and rubbing her lower body against him, Yuu pushed her slender body down with both hands.

Understanding that they were going to do it in the missionary position – which was also known as male domination position in this world – in which Yuu himself had done numerous times with the three members of the student council, Eimi spread her legs with a little devil-like smile on her face and waited for Yuu to come to her.

「Fufufu.」

The one who hugged him from behind just as he was about to immediately align his hips with Eimi and get into the position for penetration was Sayaka.

Having taken off his tee shirt because he had become all sweaty, _squish_ Yuu could feel that her ample breasts were pressed against his back.

「Let me give you a hand.」

「Hahaha…」

As he felt Sayaka’s breath on his ear, he leaned his upper body forward.

Sayaka’s hands, which were wrapped around his body from behind, were gently placed on his penis, which still maintained its hardness despite having ejaculated once.

As Yuu gazed at Eimi in a slightly slanted position, he held her slender waist with one hand and her outstretched hand with his other hand, and matched only the angle of his penis.

Just by touching it with the tip of his penis, he could tell that Eimi’s secret place was sopping wet.

「Even though it is all slippery, it is very hard… and hot.」

「Fufufu, Sayaka, I’ll put it inside you too, so…」

「Ahn, geez. Right now, shove it inside me with everything you have!」

「Ah, sorry, sorry. I’m going to put it inside you now, Amy. Can I go hard from the get go?」

「Yes. Do it however you want, Yuu-kun.」

His penis, which was still held in Sayaka’s hands, was inserted into Eimi.

Being the smallest of the three, Eimi’s vagina felt narrow, but perhaps because it had already been accustomed to him, it properly accepted his penis and clamped down on it tightly.

「Ahh, ahn! Ahn, aah… Yuu-kun is… coming… into me! Haan! I have been wanting it… Hii, ahh, auu! In my deepest part!」

「Kufufu… I’ve come all the way to your deepest part! Here we go, Amy!」

「Kyan!」

Even after the insertion was complete, Sayaka was still holding him from behind, so it was a little difficult for him to move, but not so much that it would keep him from moving.

If anything, as far as Yuu was concerned, not only did he have Eimi, who suddenly became all debauched, in the front, he could also feel Sayaka’s warmth in the back, so his excitement level was showing nothing but an upward trend.

As such, from the very beginning, Yuu shook his hips in large strokes as he attacked Eimi.

「Hyaan! Y, Yuu-kun! Ahn, ahn! Amazing, it is so amazing… Hahii, hahii… I, I, I am going to cum, so… if you go that hard… Ahn! Noo, cumming… Ahh, hii! I, I am cumminggggg---!!!」

「Hahaha, so you came already. But we’re just getting started, you know?」

「Aaahn… Yuu-kun…」

Putting strength into the hand that was holding Yuu’s and raising her upper body, Eimi moved closer to her beloved Yuu and kissed him.

As they twined their tongues together after pressing their lips against each other with a smooch, Yuu didn’t stop moving his hips.

Unable to endure the movements in which he was rapidly knocking on the entrance of her womb, which had come down, Eimi arched her body back and moaned.

When Eimi shook her head from side to side as if she was trying to resist, her flaxen twin-tail hair also shook violently.

It seemed that it would not be long before she reached climax for the second time.

---

「Fufufu, being the third one, the waiting time was tough, but I am very happy that it allowed me to be alone with you like this, Yuu. Still… Even though you have ejaculated twice, your… umm, should I say sperm? … sure is unbelievably vigorous, isn’t it?」

With one hand placed on the shoulder of the cross-legged Yuu, Sayaka was trying to lower her hips slowly.

She had stretched out her other hand toward Yuu’s crotch and placed it on his meat rod, which was still towering even after ejaculating twice.

Having had a lot of semen poured into her after reaching climaxes over and over again, Eimi was still unable to get up alongside Riko.

Giving a sidelong glance at those two, right now, Yuu and Sayaka were trying to get connected with each other.

Yuu, who had buried his face between Sayaka’s ample breasts and was enjoying their softness and sweet scent, raised his face a little and looked at Sayaka.

「I mean, I love Riko, Eimi, and you, after all, Sayaka. Even now, I can’t wait to get connected with you, and ejaculate inside you as much as I can.」

「Ah…」

The glans kissed her vaginal opening and a wet squelching sound could be heard.

Making use of her own body weight, the penis slowly got swallowed into Sayaka.

When her eyes met Yuu’s, a hot rush welled up in the depths of Sayaka’s chest and she involuntarily held Yuu’s head in her arms.

It could be a motherly instinct or a protective desire for a younger boy.

At the same time, it could also be a sense of gratitude and respect for the man who had taught her the heartwarming touch of the opposite sex and the joys of sex.

If one were to express the complex emotions swirling in Sayaka’s heart in one word…

Just before the lips of Sayaka, who was bringing her face closer while looking down at Yuu from above, made contact with Yuu’s, she quietly let out two sounds.

「Love you.」

「「Nghh!」」

With their lips pressed against each other, the two were connected, deeper and deeper.

「Nghh… Hnn, ahn… Ah, ahn, aaaaaaaaaaah!!」

As Sayaka jerked her chin up and let out a long, coquettish cry, her glossy black hair shook wildly.

At the same time, she hugged Yuu tight, and her breasts that were pressed against him squishily changed their shape.

「S, Sayaka…」

「Y… Yu…u! Haaaaaan…」

「By any chance?」

「Noo.」

Having his head hugged and his face buried in her chest, he could feel her heat through his cheeks, which were coming into contact with her body.

Her face was overshadowed by her long black hair, but he could imagine Sayaka’s snow-like white cheeks stained in vermilion like a ground cherry.

「Did you come, just from putting it in?」

「Geez, Yuu!」

To hide her embarrassment, Sayaka pressed her forehead against him.

Yuu brushed away her hair, which was hanging down in front of her, and looked at Sayaka’s face up close.

Soon after, she also brought her lips closer to his.

_Chuu, chuu_ They pressed their lips together over and over again.

「It seems that… I have ended up getting completely addicted to you, Yuu… both physically and mentally…」

「The same goes for me, no?」

「Is, is that so?」

「Yes, it is. Just look.」

「Ahn!」

When Yuu thrust his hips up, Sayaka’s body jumped.

「Even though I just came… I want so much more of you that I can’t hold myself back. T, to think I would develop such a feeling…」

「Me too, I want to feel even more pleasure with you, Sayaka.」

「Nghh, ahn! So intense… Ahn! Yuu!」

「Ahh! Sayaka… You’re clamping down on me so much…」

Matching the timing Yuu thrust his hips up, Sayaka’s hips also moved in tandem.

Each time, _squelch, squelch_ a sticky wet sound could be heard from their lower abdomen areas, which were sticking close so closely to each other.

Before they knew it, Sayaka’s long legs were wrapped around Yuu’s waist, as if she would never let him go.

Since their bodies were sticking so closely to each other, the movements themselves were small, but as he rapidly knocked on the deepest part of her vagina with her hard meat rod, each and every fold of her vaginal walls twined around and stroked him as if trying to squeeze his sperm out of him.

「Ah, ah, Sa…yakaa!」

「Y… Yu…u! Nghh, ahhh… I am coming, again! Yuu, Yuuuu… Haan, hiin! I, I am coming! I am… coming again, so! Ah, noo, coming, coming, I am coming!」

Even as he shook his hips furiously, Yuu stared at the face of Sayaka, who was moaning with her tongue out in front of him.

Finding even the melty look on her face as she completely became a prisoner of pleasure lovely, he stoked her glossy, pleasant-to-the-touch hair and sucked up the sweats dripping down on her skin like marbles.

「Guh… M, me too!」

「Y, Yuu, are you going to come, too? … Kyan, ahn! It is swelling up inside me!」

「I’m going to shoot it out! Inside of you, Sayaka… all of it.」

「Aahn, give it to me! Your.. stuff… Aaaaaah! M, me too… together.」

「Kuh… Let’s cum together! Aaah!」

Pressing their cheeks against each other, the two realized that the final moment was approaching, so they hugged each other even tighter as they slammed their hips against each other.

After repeatedly thrusting his hips, the moment Yuu made a sharp thrust all the way to her deepest part, he could feel that an unprecedented electrifying stimulation was running from his hips to his back.

「Ahh, S, Sayaka! Cumming!」

「Yu…uuu! It is coming! The amazing stuff is… Ahh, ahh, ahh, aaaaaaaaah… Ohh! It is coming out! The hot stuff is… I, I am also… comingggg…」

Feeling the hot sperm getting poured into her womb, Sayaka welcomed her greatest climax of the day, and due to how strong the impact was, she forgot to even think as her consciousness began to slowly fade away.

As Sayaka went limp and looked like she was about to fall over, Yuu held her head in a panic and breathed a sigh of relief.

From over Sayaka’s shoulder, he could see that Riko and Eimi, who were lying sprawled on the floor, were looking at them with a smile on their faces.

「Whenever I do it with Yuu-kun, it always feels so that I end up coming over and over again, but it felt especially amazing today…」

「I have to agree. Or rather, thanks to Yuu, my common sense about boys has been overturned.」

「But that’s simply because Yuu-kun is special, isn’t it-?」

「Hmm… You may be right. If so, I don’t think I will be able to do such a thing with any other boy but Yuu.」

「Me too. I can only think about Yuu-kun!」

As the two of them engaged in such a conversation while looking at him, he couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed.

However, including Sayaka, who was his first partner, Riko and Eimi were also special existences for Yuu as they had spent a lot of time together.

Even now that he had experienced sex with a number of women, there was no change to that fact
