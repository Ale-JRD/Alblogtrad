## Chapter 83 - Request to the Security Personnel -Touch-

When Kanako returned and opened the door from the entrance to the communal space and saw the scene, she couldn’t help but open her mouth with a gasp.

After all, there she saw Touko quietly sitting in front of Yuu, who was sitting deeply in the office chair.

It was something that was only possible because of her small stature, but normally, it was a situation that would not be possible unless they were in a very intimate relationship.

「Wha, what are you doing?!」

「Tch, she’s back already.」

Kanako caught Touko’s quiet mutter, and her brow wrinkled.

Yuu, who had been looking at Touko’s head and doing something, didn’t notice and after a while he looked at Kanako and smiled, still holding the brush in his hand.

「Welcome back, Kanako-san. You see, Touko-san doesn’t seem to take care of her hair very much, so I’m doing it for her.」

「I, see…」

「You have nice raw materials, so I think you should take care of yourself properly, Touko-san.」

「It’s a pain. But… If, if you will do it for me, Yuu-sama…」

「Wha, what are you-」

Before Kanako could interject, Yuu went and replied.

「It can’t be helped. You’ve been taking care of me all this time, so I don’t mind doing this much for you, but you see… You’re a girl, so let’s strive so that you can do it on your own as much as possible.」

「I’ll consider it positively.」

「Hahaha. Please do. Look, it’s pretty now.」

Bringing over the hairbrush and a number of styling products used by his mother and elder sister, Yuu first wet her hair in the washroom, and then dried it while brushing it.

After that, they moved here for the finishing touch.

It probably would have been a better idea to go to a hair salon and have them style it in the modern style, but Touko was quite the lazy person and had no interest in polishing her outward appearance, so it was probably impossible.

However, if you looked closely, you could see that she had a cute face.

The voluminous sides of her hair were swept back, and the bangs, which were a little bushy, were scattered moderately.

With only that, it made her look cuter than usual, even if it was the style of the 80’s idols in Yuu’s memory.

Yuu noticed that Kanako had a shopping bag snugly stuffed in both hands.

「I thought it was unusual of you to not be here, but were you out shopping, Kanako-san?」

「No, this is…」

The resident security personnel couldn’t be away for long.

As such, they regularly asked a company employee to go shopping for them, which Kanako would pick up in the parking space in the basement.

While she was at it, she would pick up some documents from the company, so she should be gone for about 10 to 15 minutes only.

And, as if switching places with Kanako, Yuu had happened to come over and had been taking care of Touko’s hair.

Since the time when his elder sister Elena was shut in, Yuu had often come in and out of the security personnel’s room.

Kanako and Touko were bewildered when Yuu first started coming over, but now they welcomed him with open arms.

As they chatted, Yuu also got to hear their personal stories, which made him happy.

Kanako had a younger brother who was one year older than Yuu, and partly because of their age difference, it seemed that they were close to each other like any normal siblings.

However, he went and moved into a dormitory at a boys’ school last year, so she was feeling lonely, or something.

In fact, there was a picture of the two of them side by side at Kanako’s seat.

Touko’s father was a ladies’ man, which was unusual for a man of this world, and it seemed that he had taken seven women as his wives.

Touko herself was the child of his sixth wife and was apparently the third youngest one among the thirteen brothers and sisters.

The family seemed to be a large and lively one living in a magnificent mansion, but he was curious to know how Touko lived among them.

The place was smaller than the Hirose family’s living space, probably only about 2DK.

In addition to a kitchen that was slightly smaller than the Hirose family’s, there was a toilet and a bath. At the back, there was a private room that the two were using as their bedroom.

The place Yuu and the others were currently at was a room about 12 tatami mats in size, which was located the dining room.

The floor was covered with a plain gray carpet, and there was a long desk, which would probably be only enough to be used by three people side by side, and three office chairs.

On the plain white walls, in addition to a calendar, there were several sheets of paper, including a map of the city and its surroundings and a timetable.

The shelves arranged by the wall were also rugged, steel-made ones, like those in an office.

Coupled with the fact that there was also a case for papers, a word processor, and a faxphone on the desk, the place gave off a faint air of a small office.

Usually, Yuu and Martina were in charge of dinner on Saturdays and Sundays, but when he told her that he would be late today because of student council-related work, Martina said she would buy something on her way home from work.

After the meeting with Sairei, he enjoyed a foursome with the three members of the student council, and by the time he got home, it was already almost 6:00 PM.

When Martina was not home, Elena would follow him around most of the time, and since it was Saturday, Sera had also come over from the company’s dormitory.

In contrast to her ephemeral, fairy-like appearance, Sera showed no reservation.

As expected, she had learned to show some restraint in Martina’s presence, but she was the type of person who did anything as they pleased: begging for kisses whenever she saw an opportunity, putting her hands through the gaps of his clothes and stroking his body around, getting carried away and touching his penis, and to top it off, exposing her lower half and sneaking into his bed.

Truly a perverted woman.

Though, Yuu was the kind of guy who would strike back in a fair and square manner when faced with things that would make ordinary boys run away, so it was probably understandable that Sera ended up finding it pleasing.

As expected, he was tired today, so he had come to the security personnel’s room as soon as he left his luggage at home.

This was also because Yuu had a business with these girls.

「Well then, now that Kanako-san has returned, can I have a talk with you?」

When he placed his hand on the small shoulder in front of him with a pomf, Touko stood up.

Turning around, Touko had a somewhat reluctant look on her face.

「T, thank you. Yuu-sama.」

「You are welcome.」

Yuu sat down on the two-person sofa placed on the opposite side of the shelves for visitors and faced Kanako and Touko who had taken their seats.

「You see, I came here today to ask you two a favor.」

「A favor, you say?」

「Yes. I want to learn self-defense techniques from you two.」

「「Huh?!」」

Not only Kanako, even Touko showed a look of surprise on her face.

What Yuu had in mind was his experience of meeting the delinquent girls when he went out to the town on his own.

The other was his experience of getting dragged into a toilet stall when he went into the men’s restroom on the day he went to cheer for the tournament.

As far as Yuu was concerned, those girls were worth having sex with, so both of these experiences were all right result-wise.

And then, today, he met the members of the student council of Sairei Academy High School and was subjected to their unreserved approach.

It was not like he didn’t like these girls.

If anything, he would even love to personally ask out the president, Rinne, or Keiko aka Kate, whom he had met for the first time in a while.

However, like the past precedent with Ichimatsu, there was guarantee that it would always be beautiful women who came after Yuu.

He would like to be spared from getting attacked by ugly women who would make him want to run away at the first sight.

In that sense, he thought learning some self-defense techniques would do him good in the future.

「I would like to ask you one question.」

Kanako, who had straightened up her posture, looked at Yuu and asked…

「Yuu-sama, do you remember the contents of the 『Life Safety Guide for Boys』?」

「The 『Life Safety Guide for Boys』?」

「Yes. From what I heard, it is handed out to all boys when they graduate from elementary school.」

He did feel like he had seen a booklet with such a name written on it in his desk drawer.

As he reached back into his memory, it seemed that he had flipped through the contents of the booklet and read it briefly when it was handed out.

Though, more than three years had passed since then, so he didn’t remember the details.

「Hmm. I do remember reading it, but I don’t think I remember much about it.」

「Well, I suppose that is just how it is.」

Kanako gave a small sigh.

There were probably few people who read it enthusiastically.

Touko took over the talk.

「It is written in the 『Life Safety Guide』, but even if you get attacked by a woman, it is not recommended to resist. As a rule, the only move you can use is to run away. On top of that, you ought to ask for help from your security personnel, guards, the police, or others around you.」

「Huh… isn’t that…」

「In case there is more than one sex offender, it is often premeditated and it can be difficult to resist or escape. Even if it is just a spontaneous solo attack, the other party is in a state of excitement, so if you thoughtlessly resist, it might result in injury or even loss of life in the worst-case scenario. The best thing to do is not to act without an escort and stay away from places filled with nothing but women.」

「Ugh…」

Both of these were things that Yuu had done.

「Even so, Yuu-sama, do you still want to learn self-defense technique?」

「Y… Yes. I do.」

「In that case, you should look for a male expert…」

「Can’t you two teach me?」

「It, it is not that we can’t, but…」

「If that’s the case! I think it would end up putting an extra burden on both of you, but please, I beg of you!」

Three months had passed since his rebirth, but he still felt uncomfortable about being protected by women.

The reason why Yuu wished to train his body as soon as he was discharged from the hospital or to have the bare minimum skills to fight was probably due to the instincts that he originally had as a man.

Though, he was contradicting himself as he asked help from his security personnel, who were women.

Having Yuu bow his head toward them, Kanako and Touko couldn’t refuse.

「Neki.」

Kanako showed a troubled look as Touko poked her with her elbow, but it wasn’t like she truly disliked the idea.

「Well then, when shall we start? Tomorrow just happens to be Sunday, so… Ah, you have an appointment at 10:00 a.m., right?」

Kanako muttered as she turned around and looked at the timetable.

「Ahh! Now that you mention it…」

Yuu remembered that Inui Rumiko, an official of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, had contacted them the night before yesterday.

●○●○●○●○●

At 8:30 on Sunday morning, Yuu came to the Saitama Training Center of MALSOK, Kanako and Touko’s company.

The purpose was to learn the basics of self-defense and how to carry himself in case he was attacked by a woman.

Though, since they needed time to travel to their next appointment, they could only stay there for about an hour at most.

When they went down to the basement, he saw a place that appeared to be a training area, half of which was a judo hall with tatami mats, and the other half was covered with low rebound mats that looked like it could be used for wrestling.

As expected, it’s early in the morning, so there’s no one here; so Yuu thought, but in fact, Kanako had called the day before and reserved the place for their use.

Told to wear something easy to move in, Yuu was wearing the school’s designated short-sleeved gym clothes and shorts.

However, as soon as the two saw it, they begged him to put on the top and bottom of jerseys that were in the training area.

Kanako was wearing a gray tank top with a white T-shirt on top of it and black leggings on the bottom.

Unlike her usual pantsuit, the thin garment showed off the lines of her body well, so he couldn’t help but get captivated by the wonderful proportions of her body.

「First, let me show you how it’s done! Yuu-sama, come at me!」

When Yuu stood on the judo floor after putting on the jersey, Touko, who was wearing a judo gi – moreover one with a black belt – said with pride.

She didn’t appear to be wearing an undershirt, so maybe she had her bra directly underneath it.

Though, regardless of whether she was wearing it underneath or not, the bulges on her chest were modest in size, so it didn’t seem like it would have much of an effect.

「Ah, hey…」

「Alright, here I come!」

Kanako was about to stop him, but Yuu, who had become eager to go at it, drew closer to Touko from the front as he tried to do Kumite (literally grappling hands, a technique from karate).

155 cm tall, Touko was particularly petite among the women of this world.

According to Kanako, despite her appearance, she was a specialist in anti-personnel combat, but combined with a face so young that she could pass for a middle or high school student, she totally didn’t look like someone qualified to serve as a security personnel.

He had actually seen Kanako in action, but he had never seen Touko fight until now.

That might have been precisely why he had let guard down.

The moment Yuu thought he had had the hand he had carelessly outstretched grabbed, he felt as if Touko’s figure disappeared.

In fact, with a movement so fast that it couldn’t be followed by the eyes, she had gotten in close to Yuu’s chest and gotten into position for a throw.

In an instant, as soon as he thought that his body had floated into the air, he felt an impact as his butt landed on the tatami mat, and he found himself getting subjected to Hadaka-jime (naked choke) on the neck from behind.

Though, since she didn’t seem to be trying to choke him for real, it didn’t hurt, but he couldn’t help but get stunned. Most likely, I’ve been hit by some kind of hip throwing technique; so Yuu thought.

「Mufufu. Yuu-sama, I got you.」

「A, ahaha. You got me.」

But the smug act of Touko, who was more like hugging him from behind rather than choking him, had to end there.

「Hey!」

Thwack!

「Ouch!」

When Yuu turned around after noticing that Touko had let go of him, he saw Touko holding her head with tears in her eyes, seemingly to have had a fist dropped on her head by Kanako.

「What would you if Yuu-sama got injured!」

「I, I’m sorry.」

After that, through Yuu’s mediation, Kanako’s anger somehow subsided and they decided to start over from the very beginning.

「When she was in high school and at a vocational school, she was at the national level in the lightweight judo division, after all. That body movement is not something that you can learn overnight.」

「Well, that’s certainly true.」

「We have limited time, so today is more of a quick introduction to self-defense, or perhaps an emergency lesson on the basics. Let’s see… for example, in cases where the opponent is alone…」

「What should I do if I were suddenly restrained from behind and got my mouth covered?」

「From behind?」

What Yuu had in mind was the time when he got dragged into a toilet stall at the kendo tournament.

If the other party had been a gorilla-like woman, he might have put up a serious resistance, but he didn’t think he would be able to win against her in terms of strength. In that case, what to do?

「I guess we’d have to actually try doing it! You play the attacker role, Kanako-san.」

「Huh?」

Turning his back on her, Yuu said to the bewildered Kanako.

「U… Umm…」

「Now, we don’t have much time, so come on!」

「Haa.」

Having no choice, Kanako moved closer to Yuu’s back.

「Try to do it like you’re restraining me for real, okay? And then, Touko-san, please tell me what to do in such a situation.」

「Uu…」

Kanako wrapped her arms around Yuu from behind in a timid manner.

Even she couldn’t hide her nervousness.

To protect Yuu, there were times when she had to stand close to him and ended up touching his body accidentally.

Even when that happened, Yuu never showed any sign of hating it, and there were even times when he personally held her hand when we were riding in the car.

But hugging him from behind was too much stimulation.

Yuu turned around and looked at Kanako with a smile on his face.

「You can, hold me tighter, you know?」

「Hyah… Yes.」

Moving both of Yuu’s arms to the front, Kanako stuck close to him and hugged him tightly.

Kanako was someone who guarded him on a daily basis, so for Yuu, rather than restrained, it felt more like he was being protected.

Moreover, her ample breasts were pressed against his back so hard that they were getting squashed, so he was feeling delighted inwardly.

On the other hand, as she smelled Yuu’s refreshing scent up close, Kanako’s heart wouldn’t stop pounding and her expression threatened to loosen up, but given the fact that Touko was standing right in front of them, she managed to hold it together somehow.

Looking at the two with half-closed eyes, Touko opened her mouth.

「If you get caught by a large woman like Neki like that, it won’t be easy to shake her off.」

「Yeah… You’re right.」

Although she didn’t put so much strength into her hold that it felt painful, it was true that he was getting firmly restrained by it.

Yuu also knew it was impossible to move his arms.

「But if you can at least move from the elbows down, there is something that you can do.」

Touko moved closer to Yuu from the front and took hold of his right hand without hesitation.

「There is no need to shake off her hands by force, as you can simply break her fingers.」

「Huh?」

Still holding Yuu’s hand, she moved it up, made it hold the pinky finger of Kanako’s right hand, which was restraining him, and then twisted it to the other side.

「Ou!」

Kanako, unable to bear the pain, loosened the restraint of her right arm.

「See.」

「I see.」

「There are also many people who dig their nails into the back of their assailant’s hands when resisting, but in fact, it hurts quite a lot when you dig your nails into the crescent parts of their fingernails. Do you want to try practicing it?」

Maybe she was trying to pay her back for the fist drop she had given her earlier.

It seemed that Touko had done it without reservation, and Kanako was seriously in pain.

Nevertheless, in the name of teaching Yuu, Kanako couldn’t get mad at her either.

「Err… No, I get it, so it’s fine. More importantly, Kanako-san, are you okay?」

「Y, yes. I am okay. Something like this is nothing.」

As Yuu held her hand worriedly, Kanako put up with it and managed to show him a smile.

Next, Touko stood right next to Yuu as he stood face-to-face with Kanako.

This was a case where he got attacked from the front in an indoor passageway or a narrow alley.

「The human body has certain vital areas that cannot be trained. For example, the eyes, temples, and cervical spine. But it is difficult to attack the face when dealing with a tall woman like this.」

Today’s Touko was unusually talkative.

「In case there is a height difference, the lower half of the body is easier to attack. For instance, the most well-known target, the groin…」

Touko pointed to Kanako’s lower abdomen.

Her leggings were tightly wrapping around her lower body, and as he stared at her there, it didn’t not look like they were digging into it a little.

「If the kick to the groin hits well, the opponent will surely faint in agony. But in reality, by anticipating the motion of the kick, it will end up getting avoided easily. Yuu-sama, as a test, try kicking me.」

「Huh…?」

「It’s all right.」

Although different from men who had a bull’s-eye down there, women’s groin could be a vital point, too.

As expected, he couldn’t help but hesitate to kick her there.

However, Kanako slowly moved closer to Yuu with her hands outstretched to the front like a zombie.

When the distance between them was shortened to about one meter, Yuu, having no choice, tried to kick her at the groin with his right leg, using the same trick like when kicking the ball in football, but not only did Kanako readily close her legs to stop his kick, she even put her hands on his shoulders.

「I got you!」

「Ah… You got me.」

The one-legged Yuu grabbed both of Kanako’s hands for balance.

Kanako showed a happy look on her face.

Coming to an understanding that the groin kick was a risky attack, Yuu and Kanako went back to square one and stood facing each other again.

This time, he decided to have them teach him effective counter techniques that could be easily performed even by amateurs with no martial arts training.

One was the knee kick.

As it required less motion than the football kick Yuu did earlier, it was easier to hit.

The other was the palm strike.

It was an attack in which you struck the thick part of the palm near the wrist or the hard part at the base of the hand at your opponent head-on.

If done well, it would allow you to inflict heavier damage that penetrated the internal organ of the attack target compared to a Seiken-zuki (karate punch) or punch attack.

The disadvantages were that it had a short reach, which could be scary if it missed, and even if it was successful, there was the risk of injuring your wrist.

In combat, the basic approach was to aim at the tip of the nose or chin, but when used by amateurs in self-defense, it was also a good idea to aim at the chest, with the heart in mind.

From Yuu’s point of view, it was similar to the image of a sumo wrestler’s tsuppari (thrust).

「Now then, begin!」

「Practical training again?」

「Yuu-sama, it is okay. I have been training myself, so please come at me without holding back.」

「Umm. Then…」

Just like before, Kanako moved closer to him from the front.

Getting caught would spell the end of him, so Yuu ducked to slip through Kanako’s outstretched hands and then extended his right hand straight with the palm facing the front. The target was her large overhanging breasts.

However, unable to shake off the perception that a man must not be rough with a woman, Yuu’s hand ended up losing its momentum in the middle of the move.

Squish.

「Ohh.」

「Ahn.」

Unconsciously, Yuu had grabbed her breast.

However, it boasted such a size that even as he used his entire palm to hold it, he was still unable to hold the entirety of it.

Amazing…

Even through the fabric, he could tell that they were springy and soft.

His spread fingertips sank into them once, but her breasts boasted such elasticity that they immediately pushed them back.

Yuu rubbed them thoroughly in a trance.

「Y, Yuu-sama… Ah… Ahn!」

Kanako was bewildered as she suddenly got her breasts rubbed, but perhaps ending up finding it somewhat pleasurable, she let out a sweet cry without trying to make Yuu stop even after grabbing him by the shoulders.

●○●○●○●○●

The self-defense lesson came to an end after about an hour, and Kanako and Touko were in the middle of getting dressed.

「Phew… it was harder to continuously maintain my reason than usual.」

「True enough, there was a lot of physical contact this time. Talk about a perk.」

「That’s not what I’m talking about…」

Down to her underwear after taking off her top, Kanako looked at her own breasts, and after thinking about it for a while, she tried to touch them.

Even though she felt no emotion whatsoever when she touched them herself, she couldn’t help but be bewildered by the indescribable pleasure that had run through her body when they were rubbed by Yuu earlier.

Seeing this, Touko also looked down at her modest breasts wrapped in a sex appeal-less white sports bra.

She couldn’t help but be surprised when she saw the look on Kanako’s face earlier.

If she were to get her breasts rubbed by Yuu, how would it feel?

Touko couldn’t help but be curious about it.

## Chapter 84 - Special Examination (1) -Entrust your body to the flow of time-

Going back in time, it was Thursday, the day before the inter-class ball game competition.

It was about 6:00 p.m. when Yuu got home that day, and unusually, they had visitors at such an hour.

It seemed that it hadn’t been long since they arrived, and the two visitors had just taken their seats.

Elena, who happened to be at home, and Sera, who normally would only come on the weekend, were also present.

It was apparently a talk that was heavily related to Yuu as well, so as soon as he got home, he sat down on the sofa facing them.

One of the visitors was Inui Rumiko, an official of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.

He met her at the general hospital when he went to do his first sperm donation, so it had been about two weeks since.

She was dressed in a business style with a white open-necked shirt and a tight navy-blue skirt, but her curvy body as male-instincts-stirring as usual.

The other visitor was an old lady… not sure if she could be referred to as such, but she was a woman that looked like she had reached her 60th birthday.

Her hair, which was more gray than black, was neatly bundled in an updo, and she wore rimless glasses.

She was dressed in a rather plain but flower-patterned shirt and a long pale purple skirt, and although she had a small build, looking at her good posture with her back straight, one could see her elegance.

When her eyes met Yuu’s, she looked at him with a gaze overflowing with affection from behind her droopy glasses, which strangely made him feel a little warm.

「Yuu-sama has returned home at just the right time, so I will go ahead and introduce her to you. She is the chairperson of the Toyota Sakuya Memorial Foundation, Ichinose Hatsumi-san.」

The woman called Ichinose bowed and opened her mouth.

「As introduced by her, I am Ichinose.」

「B, by Ichinose, don’t tell me…」

Perhaps she knew her name, Martina had a look of surprise on her face.

「Yes, as you might guess, I was given the pleasure to serve as Sakuya-san’s first partner.」

It was a well-known story that when Yuu’s father, Toyota Sakuya, was 10 years old – said to be shortly after entering the fifth grade – he shed his virginity with his homeroom teacher at the time.

Even if the other party was a beautiful child, as expected, as a teacher, she couldn’t actively lay her hands on him, so when Ichinose, who was 25 years old at the time, was subjected to a fierce attack by Sakuya, who harbored a desire toward her unlike that of an elementary student, they began to gradually form a physical relationship.

Otherwise, there was no way she would have been able to continue working as a teacher even after it was discovered that she had had sexual intercourse with an elementary school boy.

This was because when she became pregnant, Sakuya boldly declared in front of the principal that he had impregnated her.

The relationship continued while Sakuya was still in elementary school, and it was said that she gave birth to a boy and a girl.

Although they were not bound in marriage, for Yuu, she was the mother of his oldest half-brother and sister.

He learned all of the above from a TV special on the anniversary of his father’s death.

「Nice to meet you. I am Martina, Sakuya-san’s 18th wife. This is my daughter Elena and my son Yuu. And then Sera, daughter of Suzanna, his 17th wife. She lives in Hokkaido, but she happens to have come here for a company training program.」

Introduced by Martina, Yuu and the others greeted her in turn.

Hatsumi looked at Yuu and the others with an amiable smile on her face, but when it came to Yuu in particular, she directed a gaze at him with a nostalgic and affectionate look on her face.

「How curious. Even though they are different in appearance, in some ways, he looks like Sakuya-san in his younger days. I wonder why.」

Hearing those words that she had muttered while placing her hand on her cheek as if she was talking to herself, Martina had a complicated look on her face, while Rumiko nodded her head as if in agreement.

「Err, Ichinose-san?」

The one who broached the subject was Martina. She looked a little nervous.

「Hatsumi is fine. Martina-san. What might it be?」

「Huh… Then, Hatsumi-san. I heard that you had a tough time after Sakuya-san passed away?」

It seemed that the same was true for Martina and the others in that not only were they in sorrow over the loss of their beloved husband, they were also faced with a tough situation, but they didn’t show even a fragment of it.

Getting asked, Hatsumi humbly replied, 「Not as much as you who were his wives, but…」, as she showed a nostalgic look on her face.

「I believe it was about a month after Sakuya-san passed away. A lot of strange people came to our house, did they not-?」

「Huh, but why?」

Yuu wondered.

He had heard that the relationship between his father and Hatsumi had been severed after he graduated from elementary school.

Considering that she had given birth to his children, maybe he had met her after that too, but it could be said that his father’s sexual conquest began in earnest when he entered middle school.

According to them, that was because even his father didn’t have it in him to impregnate elementary school girls, as expected.

There, the one who interrupted was Rumiko.

「When he was alive, Sakuya-shi was called many different names by the media and his fans. For example… From the fact that he had relationships and children with an unbelievably large number of women, the famous one is Sir Stud. From the fact that he actively formed relationships not only with Japanese but also foreigners, using sea as the metaphor for women, Supreme King of the Sea. And from the fact that he was the ray of hope for all women on the earth, there was even a one like the Lord of Salvation.」

「Ha, hahaha… that’s amazing.」

「Not only would he embrace you if there was an opportunity to, the chance of having a child was high. Even if you didn’t get embraced by him, his popularity appeared to be very great, so there might those who pretty much deified him.」

「So, who were those strange people who came uninvited to Hatsumi-san’s house?」

In response to Yuu’s question, Hatsumi and Rumiko looked at each other.

It seemed that Rumiko would be the one to explain.

「After Sakuya-shi passed away, several religious groups were established. The one who was deified and worshiped was, of course, Sakuya-shi. The names of the groups were taken from the titles of honor I mentioned earlier, such as 『Servants of the Supreme King of the Sea』 and 『Lord of Salvation Religion』. Among them, it seems that there were also cases where private fan clubs that had existed even before his death were taken over by fanatics. And then, it seems that there was a need to put a living person as a representative, or rather a position that served as their symbol, so…」

「Suzanna and Emanuela told me about it. They said that in addition to people from the media, strange people also started to come to their houses, which was very troublesome, so they decided to move.」

Martina, who was pregnant with Yuu, had gone into hiding early on, but it seemed that the wives who had remained at their original residence had also been visited by such religious groups.

Though, partly because there was actually no hierarchical order among the wives, even if there were orders for their turns, it seemed that the groups were not obsessed with them enough to seek out the place they were moving to.

Instead, it was Hatsumi who caught their attention.

After all, she was Sakuya’s first woman, so she was perfect to serve as a symbol.

「Dear me… It was just strange, you know? For them to capture a mere old teacher like me, calling me Queen or the Lord’s consort.」

She might have been able to laugh about it now, but one could imagine how tough it must have been for her at the time.

Among the new religious groups, the groups that called themselves the so-called Cult were not people with whom words would work.

For the sake of their doctrine, they couldn’t care less about the convenience or inconvenience of others.

If anything, they even had no qualm in committing criminal acts because they truly believed it was a good deed.

According to the current time line, it was something that occurred several years later, but Yuu recalled that in his former world, a certain cult group had caused a terrorist incident that resulted in the death of numerous people.

「Well, it ended up causing inconvenience to my work too, you see. So I asked for help from the government. I quit my job at the school and went abroad, mainly working to help set up schools in Southeast Asian countries. Then, exactly 10 years ago, I believe, I was invited to join the board of directors of the foundation I am currently working for, and decided to devote what little ability I could.」

Then, the talk finally got down to the main business.

「In the foundation, we not only collect and store all of Sakuya-san’s inheritances and documents, but also secure people related to him, such as his wife, lovers, and children. In addition to social gatherings and consultations that we hold on an irregular basis, we also send out a seasonal newsletter, so I believe it has been delivered to your place too, Martian-san.」

「Aah… Yes, indeed. But…」

It was the first time Yuu had heard about it.

That was because except for the two she had shown in the photo, Suzanna and Emanuela, Martina had never mentioned any of her fellow wives or other children, and she had always kept quiet about the fact that there were such connections.

With the same gentle smile, Hatsumi said to Martina.

「I understand your concern, Martina-san. The foundation is a special organization, and we don’t allow any media coverage. As a rule, we keep our information non-public. Well, there are times when receive requests for cooperation from the government in matters relation to Sakuya-san, though.」

Hatsumi looked at Rumiko.

「We are conducting a special examination on all of Sakuya-shi’s children after they turn fifteen years old. Due to various circumstances, there are also those who do not undergo this examination, but Yuu-sama, the youngest child, happens to have become eligible for it, so we are thinking about asking Elena-sama and Sera-sama, who have not undergone it before, to undergo it together with him, too.」

「An examination, is it? Is it different from the physical examination I had in April?」

「Yes, it is. There will be a physical examination too, but if I have to put it, I believe the purpose will be to have you show us your psychological side.」

Rumiko seemed to have prepared some pamphlets.

However, the thickness of the one given to Yuu was different from the one given to Elena and Sera.

Excluding the cover, Elena and Sera’s pamphlet was a double-sided one with two pages worth of contents, but Yuu’s appeared to be roughly five or six pages long.

「Do the men receive more examinations, you know, in a lot of ways?」

「Seems like so. Especially on sexual-related matters.」

「Sexual… Will you be okay? To receive such an examination.」

Martina was naturally apprehensive.

In her mind, Yuu was probably still just an innocent 15-year-old boy.

「Hmm. I think it’s going to be okay. There is also this psychological test thingy, so it sounds interesting.」

Having flipped and scanned through the pamphlet, Yuu turned to Martina, who still had a worried look on her face, and answered with a smile to reassure her.

●○●○●○●○●

After learning self-defense techniques from the security personnel, Kanako and Touko, first thing Sunday morning, Yuu headed for the Saitama University Hospital located in the prefectural capital.

They had been informed in advance, so they parked their car in the staff parking lot behind the main building.

As expected, this, too, was probably to avoid the eyes of the general patients and their families.

Surrounded by his security personnel, Yuu headed for the inconspicuous entrance for the staff, and found that two women had been waiting for him.

「Yuu!」

「Ah, big sis, big sis Sera! You arrived earlier than I expected. I thought I got here first.」

「W, well yeah… ahaha.」

「If Elena was alone, she would definitely not have arrived on time, would she?」

「Y… Yes, it is all thanks to Sera.」

「Aah, I see.」

During her high school years, Elena commuted by bus, so she rarely had the chance to board a train.

Coupled with her introverted personality and obsession with Yuu, she rarely even went outside the town by herself during her three years of high school.

It was thanks to Sera, who was a surprisingly dynamic person, that she was able to take the train to get here.

As they went in through the entrance, waiting for them were Rumiko and a group of women in their 20s to 40s in plain suits, probably Rumiko’s subordinates and the hospital’s clerical staff. Including a veteran nurse in a white coat and a hospital security guard, there were a total of eight people.

Yuu felt that this was a very high-profile welcome, but it might have been because this examination held great significance.

There, they were told Yuu would have to temporarily with part Elena and Sera to undergo a special menu.

The two girls’ examination would finish in the morning, but it seemed that being a man, Yuu’s examination would continue until the evening because of the large number of examination subjects.

As such, he contacted Kanako and Touko before they left.

And he decided to meet Elena and Sera for lunch.

「Then, let’s have lunch together, shall we?」

「Got it, big sis. I might end up making you wait again, though.」

「It’s fine. I’ll be waiting for you, Yuu.」

Elena gave him a wide smile.

If you looked at that part only, she was just a normal elder sister who doted on her little brother.

The one who quietly approached him from the side and whispered in his ear was Sera.

「I’ll be waiting for you, so after lunch, let me drink some of your dick milk, okay, Yuu?」

「Haa…」

With a giggle and a mischievous smile on her face, Sera moved away.

The fact that you could never tell where she learned such words, or whether she was being serious or joking, was the curious thing about Sera, and Yuu couldn’t help by get exasperated by it.

●○●○●○●○●

「Thank you for your hard work. Now then, after a one-hour break, we will start the afternoon examination, okay?」

「Yes, ma’am. I understand… Haa. I’m tired…」

After confirming that the nurse and security guard who had been accompanying him the whole time had left, Yuu sighed softly.

CT scan, MRI, EEG and EKG tests with electrodes, ultrasound echo, and even blood and urine tests.

Since there were no patients other than Yuu, there was almost no waiting time, and he went from one room to another, continuously taking examinations single-mindedly as if he were being put on a conveyor belt.

To finish it off, a group of doctor and nurses palpated every part of his body.

It also included the genitals, and as he had it directly touched by a beautiful nurse in her mid-twenties who looked a little like Shiho, he inevitably got an erection.

Perhaps because it was a huge penis. Not only did they look at it with gazes filled with surprise and heat, they even went and took pictures of him in his half-naked state.

While Yuu was thinking that it was pretty exciting to be touched all over by a female doctor and nurses like that, the palpation was over.

The doctor and the nurses must have found it very unusual that Yuu was so calm and unconcerned even as he got his body touched while being subjected to their heated gazes.

Each and every one of them expressed their gratitude and apologies.

「I truly appreciate it. Thanks to your cooperation, we were able to finish faster than I expected.」

「I am sorry for making you endure being surrounded by women for such a long time.」

「No, it’s not a problem at all. If anything, I was happy to be surrounded by beautiful young ladies like you.」

When Yuu answered so, the girls openly heaved out a sigh of relief, and their cheeks reddened with happiness.

Done with the long, three hour examination, Yuu felt a rush of mental fatigue as soon as he entered the break room where his elder sisters were waiting for him.

It was probably to check in detail that there was no abnormality on his body.

The fact that Yuu was able to finish the examination in half a day, which would normally take a lot of money and time, was probably proof that he was being given preferential treatment.

It seemed that Yuu underwent the examination in a place called D wing of the building consisting of four wings.

It seemed that this wing was usually used for men, and the only people he saw there other than the nurses and other staff members were a few elderly inpatients.

He was taken to the break room on the third floor of D wing for lunch, and perhaps because the place had been cleared in advance, there were only Elena and Sera inside the room, which was about the size of a school classroom.

While Yuu was still wearing his inspection clothes, which looked like pajamas made of a thin fabric, over his T-shirt and underpants, the girls had already changed into the same clothes they had worn when they arrived.

Elena was wearing a rough combination of a short, light purple cutsew that almost showed her navel and slim jeans.

In contrast, Sera was wearing a white dress with lots of frills, just like when he saw her for the first time. Perhaps because the sun was shining today, she had also brought a straw hat with a red ribbon.

Judging by appearance alone, she looked like a young lady of some sort.

「Good work-. Now, let’s eat the bento!」

「You must be hungry, no? Which one do you want?」

「Thank you. For getting one for me, too.」

It seemed that they had bought them in advance, as there were three bentos lined up on the table.

Looking at the contents of each bento, Yuu gave a small smile.

Most likely, the salmon nori bento was Sera’s favorite, while the hamburger steak bento was Elena’s favorite.

Which meant, the remaining one, the makunouchi bento (a bento consisting of mostly rice along with fish, meat, pickles, eggs, vegetables, and an umeboshi (a salt pickled plum)), was Yuu’s.

As he ate his bento facing his two elder sisters in the empty room, they talked about the morning’s examination.

Apparently, the two didn’t get a full body examination like Yuu, but mainly female-specific examinations of the breasts, genitals, uterus, and so on.

They explained to him without any embarrassment, pointing to their breasts and crotches all the while, which ended up making Yuu embarrassed instead.

After that, it seemed that they also answered some questions about their menstrual habits and sex-related matters during an interview, but there was one scene where Yuu stopped Sera as she tried to tell him about it in detail.

The break time was eventually coming to an end.

Done with their examination, the two said that since they had come all the way here, they would go to the department store in front of the station and do some shopping before going home.

「Well then, Yuu, good luck with your afternoon examination, too.」

「Yeah, and you take care too, big sis. Make sure not to get lost, okay?」

「I get it, duh.」

Getting up to head to the exit, Yuu had his right hand held by Elena, who had moved closer to him from the side.

His other arm was, of course, held by Sera, who pressed her chest against it.

The chest of her dress was wide open, so when Yuu looked down he could see her cleavage.

「I didn’t get to drink your dick milk, Yuu. When you get home… Let’s do it?」

「Hahaha… Only if I still have any strength left.」

「Don’t worry, you can just lie down and do nothing, Yuu.」

「You mustn’t leave big sis out, okay?」

「I get it, duh.」

「Ahn!」

Shaking his arms free, Yuu pulled the two toward him at the same time with his left and right hands.

Elena’s light brown hair and Sera’s platinum blonde hair,

When he stroked them with his palms, both of them were silky and pleasant to the touch.

While stroking their hair, he exchanged kisses with the two in turn.

As the three of them hugged each other tightly after repeating the kiss five or six times, they heard a knock on the door.

「Then, see you later. Big sis, big sis Sera.」

「Bye-bye, Yuu.」

「Yuu, I’ll be waiting for you in the nude, so…」

After parting with his two elder sisters, Yuu was escorted by the nurse and security guard who had come to pick him up, and headed off to undergo the afternoon examination.

---

## Chapter 85 - Special Examination (2) -You’re the Only…-

In contrast to the morning session, the afternoon session consisted of a personality assessment including a psychological test by a psychiatrist and an interview with a specialist in sexual problems.

The psychological test consisted of a test in which he was shown a strange picture and asked what it looked like, a test in which he had to answer 「yes,」 「no,」 or 「neither」 to a question, a test in which he had to make up a short story (past, present, or future) from a picture depicting a certain scene, and so on.

It also included the psychological test Yuu was familiar with, but gradually the number of questions associated with male-female relationships and sexuality went up.

In the interview following that, he was subjected to a pretty in-depth questioning about his thoughts on women, his interest in sex, and even his past experiences with women.

As far as Yuu was concerned, he was not sure how much he should answer, but the other party was a counselor who stated at the very beginning that she was a bisexual woman who liked both men and women.

She was a dignified woman who made him think that if Kuroda Noriko, with whom he had a sexual encounter in the stall of the men’s restroom, were to polish herself in the right direction for another 10 years or so, maybe she would turn into such a woman, and he certainly felt that she would probably be popular with women as well.

Moreover, as she voluntarily told him about her sexual experiences (with both men and women), Yuu also had no choice but to answer her questions to a certain extent.

In spite of her androgenous-ish good looks, she always sported an amiable smile on her face, and her way of speaking was unique, so he felt like he had spent a surprisingly fun time talking with her.

After a short break, in a room that seemed to be an examination room, he was made to sit on a bed with cords, which looked like the ones used when taking an electrocardiogram, attached to his head and chest.

There, to his surprise, women, who seemed to range in age from 10 to 40, came in and out of the room by turns.

For around one minute per person, he chatted and engaged in light body touch, including handshakes, with the other party as she leaned in close right next to him.

There were 50 women in total, in which about a third were women who clearly screamed foreigners.

Some were plain, some were very pretty. Some were thin, some were plump.

Maybe they wanted to know the type of woman he liked, as well as the scope of his strike zone.

When he was told that he could touch any part of their body he liked without reservation, he was at a loss what to do, so at the beginning, he only softly patted their heads and lightly hugged them, but gradually he became bolder and went ahead and touched their breasts and buttocks.

●○●○●○●○●

After Yuu finished the afternoon examination, the nurse led him to a small room where Rumiko and another woman in her late 20s, wearing a plain suit, were waiting for him.

The business card she gave him said that she belonged to the secretariat of the Toyota Sakuya Memorial Foundation.

「Thank you for your hard work today. With this, we are done with the examination… is what I would like to say, but…」

「Huh?」

Just as he was about to heave out a sigh of relief, he thought, 「There’s still something more to come, huh」, and couldn’t help but put himself on guard.

Rumiko, seeing that action of Yuu, sported a mischievous smile on her face.

「Fufufu. No need to be so on guard. It is simply that I want to have some talk with you about today’s examination. Also, I have one last request, but I will leave it up to you whether you accept it or not, Yuu-sama.」

「Haa.」

Facing each other on the sofa were Yuu, Rumiko, and the other lady from the secretariat.

So far, she had been maintaining her poker face, but as Yuu sent fleeting glances at her since her sharp and composed face was quite the beautiful one, she ended up hanging her head bashfully.

Maybe she’s an unexpectedly innocent person; thinking so, Yuu held a favorable impression toward her inwardly.

Rumiko, picking up some finely printed paper, began to talk.

「It will take a few days to get the detailed results of the examination you had today, so like before, we will mail them to you at a later date. Well, from what we can tell at this point, it seems like there is nothing wrong with your body, including congenital diseases. We can conclude that you are in extremely good health, Yuu-sama.」

「That’s… a relief.」

The examination was done at a fast pace, but it was very detailed.

Getting reborn as a boy of a tender age of 15 was fine and all, but Yuu was relieved to know that there were no strange abnormalities in his body.

「Moreover… Despite having strong interest in women, you are very considerate and equally tolerant towards them regardless of their ages. Just like your own appearance, your genitalia are of the supremely finest quality, Yuu-sama. More importantly, you also have excellent fertility…」

Taking a glance to her side, Rumiko exchanged glances with the woman next to her.

She was nodding her head with an extremely delightful look on her face.

He was happy to be praised for that kind of thing, but Yuu felt a bit doubtful as to in what direction the talk was going.

This time, the woman from the secretariat opened her mouth.

「We have been measuring Toyota Sakuya-shi’s sons in terms of their overall similarity to their father. Although limited to the ones that have been identified to date, we call each of the characteristics that formed the person named Toyota Sakuya the S-factor, and we are examining and determining how much of the S-factor his sons have from various angles.」

Oh boy, for some reason the talk has taken a serious turn; with such a thought in mind, Yuu nodded his head.

「So far, the person who has the most S-factors scored 55 out of 100. But today, after calculating it based on the results of your examination, Yuu-sama, although it is only a provisional result, we got an astonishing score of 85!」

It was the result of Yuu’s examination, but for some reason, she puffed out her chest with pride.

Incidentally, they didn’t seem to be very big.

「E, eighty-five points… is it?」

「Yes! With you being the last generation, Yuu-sama, it is by far the highest score we have ever recorded. So amazing! Hats off to you!」

「Ahaha…」

While Yuu was having a hard time grasping how great of a significance it had, Rumiko cut into the conversation with a warm look on her face.

「Even if you are related to him by blood, you are ultimately a different person, so it is believed that scoring more than 90 points is impossible. As such, it is such an amazing score that makes you worthy to be called the true Sakuya II, Yuu-sama.」

Even after being told that much, Yuu stayed calm.

「Well, speaking of people that are called the second generation, let alone surpassing the original person, most of the time they fail to live up to their reputation, don’t they?」

In his original world, it was common practice in the sports field for the mass media to lionize promising young athletes by calling them ‘’Yada-yada II’’.

However, he had a feeling that most of the time it ended with only creating a buzz.

Though, in this case, anyone should be able to call himself the second generation as long as he was his son.

「Oh my, how humble of you. Certainly, there are some disagreements about the validity of the psychological test, which is one of the evaluations… Sakuya-shi is Sakuya-shi and Yuu-sama is Yuu-sama. Regardless of whether they are the same person or different, their dispositions and behaviors vary depending on the times and environment, after all.」

After saying that much, Rumiko took off her glasses and directed a passionate gaze at Yuu.

The woman from the secretariat was also looking at Yuu with expectant eyes.

Being stared at by two attractive women, as expected, even Yuu ended up feeling embarrassed.

「But let me tell you this. Toyota Sakuya-shi used to be called the star of hope for women of marriageable age, not only in Japan but around the world. And it can be said that you are the most suitable person to succeed him, Yuu-sama.」

True enough, Yuu, as a very common man, loved women.

He had no particular type of woman he liked, and as long as she was reasonably good looking and had an agreeable personality, he thought that was more than enough.

He used to think so, but in the past, he failed to even maintain his ties with a single woman.

But now, in this world where men were scarce, he had been reborn as a beautiful boy and was leading a life of perpetual popularity.

As most of the women showed exceptional favorability toward him, not only did it make Yuu himself happy, it also allowed him to show a relaxed attitude.

About three months had passed since he was reborn into this world.

Since he entered high school, fell in love with the student council president, and had his first experience with her, it could be said that he had had love affairs with so many women that it would have been unthinkable in his original world.

He also got into troubles at times, but he had been able to overcome them without any particular difficulties, perhaps in part due to his good luck, but it could probably be said that he had been able to carve out a path for himself through his own appearance and behavior.

「The results of this S-factor evaluation will not be released to the public. But it will be known to politicians and bureaucrats who hold a certain degree of authority. Among the women holding important positions in the political and business worlds, there are some who have had a love affair with Sakuya-shi when they were young, and even now, they still harbor strong yearning for the deceased, you see. If they find out that a person that succeeds Sakuya-shi has shown up…」

「I, I see… When you put it like that, it makes me feel some kind of pressure, but… What in the world should I do…?」

As far as Yuu was concerned, it was true that he felt elated by his rebirth, and he had planned to live his life freely, taking advantage of the fact that he was very popular with women.

But when he heard about this unexpected turn of events, he ended up getting cold feet on the inside.

That was because although he was an adult mentally, there was no change to the fact that he was a lower middle-class person.

「Ah, w, we didn’t mean to put that kind of pressure on you…」

「Ah-.」

Seeing Yuu making a troubled face, the two showed a flustered look on their faces.

Rumiko laughed bitterly and then opened her mouth in an attempt to put him at ease.

「You look more level headed than your appearance tells, but you are still only 15 years old, are you not, Yuu-sama? I am sorry for unwittingly bringing up adult talk to you. But worry not, we don’t intend to ask you, who are underage, to immediately do this and that just because you know about it. Just live your life like how you have been, Yuu-sama. That is good enough.」

「In other words, I can just act naturally like how I have been?」

「「But of course!」」

The two’s voices harmonized.

「In that case, I guess there is no need to be strangely conscious of it.」

「Yes, as long as you continue to be intimate with a lot of women without reservation from now on too, that is good enough.」

「Ahaha. Yes, well…」

Although he had thought that she would not be opposed to it, Yuu did not think that she would go as far as giving him endorsement to carry it out in an assertive manner.

「So, can I tell you about my last request now?」

「Yes.」

Rumiko licked her lower lip. As if she was licking her lips at the sight of appetizing food.

Although he felt a little scared a short while ago, Yuu had regained enough composure to think that Rumiko’s bright red rouge-plastered lips were sexy.

「In a bit, I would like to ask you to have sex with one woman, Yuu-sama… Oh my? You don’t seem surprised, do you?」

「Well… Considering the talk thus far…」

Having come this far, Yuu would not be surprised even if she were to ask him to have sex with the two women in front of him.

「Then, will it remain the same even if I were to tell you that the other party is your elder sister, even though from different mother?」

「My elder sister…is it?」

Hmm-; Yuu fell into thoughts.

For Yuu, who had actually had sexual relationships not only with Elena but also Sera, there was no reason to hesitate.

All that was left was the other party.

「It is fine. But why my elder sister?」

The one who answered Yuu’s question was the woman from the secretariat.

「After analyzing not only Sakuya-shi’s sons, but also his daughters’ tendencies and preferences, we came to know that they share certain characteristics. One of them is that they are more lecherous than most women and have a strong desire to conceive and give birth to children.」

「Ah, I see.」

He only knew Elena and Sera, but Yuu was a little relieved to know that those two were not special cases.

No, wait. I have more than a hundred or even a hundred and fifty older sisters who are not at all inferior to those two…?

Deep down, Yuu had a complicated feeling.

But if the parents were beautiful, there was a good chance that the daughters would also be beautiful, and in that sense, he couldn’t help but get very curious about them.

「There are precedents of Sakuya-shi’s children getting together and having children with each other. So far, only five children have been born to them, though.」

「Sample… I believe it is rude to call them as such, but even though there are only five of them, two of the born children were boys, you see.」

「Huh, then…」

「Perhaps the children born to Sakuya-shi’s sons and daughters will have a higher probability of being boys.」

「But incestuous marriage is…」

「Yes. I understand. There is the risk of developing recessive genes with disabilities and congenital diseases, but even if we take that into account, if the rate of boys being born is much higher than normal…」

In medieval Europe, repeated incestuous marriages among royalty and aristocrats resulted in an increase in the number of deformed and handicapped children and those who died prematurely.

In Japan, there used to be a custom of sending out young girls to do night crawling when travelers visited isolated villages deep in the mountains, but this, too, was done in order to bring in blood from the outside. It was because based on the rule of thumb, they understood that if the whole village was like a relative community, and they kept having children amongst themselves, the village would decline.

Although it was a hazy memory, Yuu had a recollection of hearing such an anecdote.

Though, he was not knowledgeable enough to know how much the risk was increased by incestuous marriages, and whether it was not good because the blood would become thicker with each generation.

It was just that, if memory serves right, according to what he heard when he went to do semen donation, Sakuya’s children had higher probability to give birth to boys than ordinary people.

It seemed that this trait was inherited to some extent by his sons, but if the partner was his daughter, there was a possibility that the probability would go up?

「I do feel sorry that this ends up turning out like some sort of human experiment, so I will not say anything even if you were to decline. But if you feel inclined, could I ask you to be her partner, Yuu-sama? Truthfully speaking, I was planning to have you choose from two or three of them, but due to their own convenience and timing issues, only one of them could come…」

Rumiko’s expression did contain a hint of apology, but it did not look as if she was not enjoying herself.

「What kind of woman is she?」

「Fufufu. I will leave the fun for when you meet her.」

I knew it, this person is enjoying herself; so Yuu thought.

「But she is someone you have met once, Yuu-sama. She is a cute girl, quiet and innocent in spite of her being twenty-three years old. Incidentally, she is 158 cm tall with a bust of 89, waist of 69, and hips of 95… A little chubby?」

「No, that is enough.」

In today’s society, it seemed that women longed to have a slender figure, so those with small stature and big breasts were not considered to be very desirable. What a waste.

In any case, Yuu decided to accept Rumiko’s request without much hesitation.

After that, he asked them to lead him to the room where the woman was waiting for him, but something that a woman called 」cute」 could be a miss from a man’s point of view, so Yuu thought that he should not expect too much.

Rather, he couldn’t help but get curious about the fact that they had met once.

●○●○●○●○●

It was a room on the top floor of D wing.

It seemed to be a special room similar to the VIP room for men in the general hospital where Yuu was once hospitalized.

Yuu felt so from the luxurious furniture and chic interior as soon as he opened the sliding door and entered the room.

Of course, the bed was one size larger than a king-size bed, and if huddled together, two or three people could probably sleep on it.

Stepping into the room, he found that the room was similar to the VIP room in which he had once been hospitalized, from the large screen CRT TV on the right side of the wall and the black leather sofa nearby.

He noticed that there was a woman sitting hunched over, curling herself up on the front side of the sofa.

「Um…」

「Yesh!」

Perhaps she didn’t notice the sound of the door opening or his footsteps, the moment Yuu called out to her, she stood up with a jump and turned around toward him.

Her black hair, which danced gently as she did so, was mid-back length. Sporting sauvage style, it was quirky and wavy from the middle.

Perhaps because they were hidden by her naturally dropping hair, she had a small face with small parts such as eyes, nose, and mouth.

As Rumiko said, her stature was shorter and smaller than the norm in this world.

Maybe she had taken a shower already, she was wearing a loose white gown, but the length of the gown was only up to her knees, so he could clearly see her surprisingly thin lower legs.

When Yuu moved closer to her, she sported a happy look on her face for a moment, but then hung her head in embarrassment.

Yuu stood in front of her and faced her.

「Err, maybe you knew it already, but I am Hirose Yuu. Umm, Inui-san told me that we have met once, but… I’m sorry. I cannot think of a name.」

「Ah… U, um, I, I, I am…」

It seemed that her excitement level had shot through the roof by the fact that Yuu was right in front of her.

He felt that there were so many innocent women with no immunity to men in this world.

Certainly, since Yuu had come into contact with so many different women, unless they were very memorable women, he had probably ended up forgetting them, but…

「Could you show me your face?」

He asked her to show him her face, which had ended up getting hidden by her hanging long hair, but she simply went 」Haa, haa」, and his words didn’t seem to reach her.

Having no other choice, Yuu leaned his body close to hers, reached out with his hand and took her chin.

「Auu.」

「Hmm.」

As she looked up at Yuu with her round and cute eyes, they looked at each other.

In an instant, her face turned red.

True enough, she was a cute girl that looked like a small animal.

He was told she was 23 years old, but she didn’t look like someone who was older than him at all.

As he approached her, the smell of shampoo and soap tickled his nostrils, making him want to touch her even more.

「So cute.」

「Y, Yuu-hyama?! Ahyuun!」

When Yuu hugged her and stroked her hair, she stood upright with her face red like a boiled octopus and surrendered herself to his touch.

Looking down at her, Yuu could see her cleavage through the open collar of her gown.

Come to think of it, she said her bust was 89cm, huh.

When he held her so tightly that their bodies were sticking very closely to each other, *squiiish* he could feel her soft breasts getting pressed against his chest.

As he was savoring the softness of her body and the heat of her cheeks, the object left on the low table came into his sight.

It was a pair of black-rimmed round glasses. The lenses seemed to be thick.

Speaking of a woman who was so innocent and prone to get excited…

Yuu moved his upper body away a little and took a look at her face.

「Nufufu, nghh-, suuuu… haaaa… H, huh?」

For some reason she was pressing the tip of her nose against Yuu’s chest, and when he took her chin, he noticed that her mouth was loosened up.

「By any chance, are you Yanai Miku-san?」

「Ah… yes.」

He remembered that she was the person from the Japan White Cross Society who had given him an advance explanation when he went to do semen donation two weeks ago.

## Chapter 86 - Special Examination (3) -Scent Charm THE VIP ROOM-

Yuu and Miku hugged each other and felt the warmth of each other’s body.

Perhaps the fact that he had called her name had eased the tension a bit, Miku gently put her hands on Yuu’s shoulder and back.

「I never thought that you were my elder sister, Miku-san.」

「Ah… Our family, is a single-mother household, and I only got to know that my father was that famous Sakuya-sama when I came of age.」

「Huh?」

「Umm… According to my mother, she was working at a hotel in Nagano, and when Sakuya-sama came for a vacation, she fell in love with him at first sight. It seems that not only when Sakuya-sama stayed at the hotel at the beginning, even after that, my mother had a tryst with him over and over again every time he visited Nagano, but… Sakuya-sama was a busy man, so it seemed that the last time my mother met him was when he came to congratulate her right after I was born. That is why to me, it doesn’t really feel real that he was my father.」

「I see.」

Considering Miku’s age, it probably took place before he married Martina, but by then, he should have had more than 10 wives already.

Even so, he must have laid his hands all over the women that suited his fancy wherever he went.

Otherwise, he would not have been able to father more than 200 children.

And one of the results of that act of his was Miku in front of him.

In Yuu’s original world, he would probably have been criticized as an irresponsible womanizer, but in this world, there were countless women who wished to get baby seeds at the very least, by all means.

Perhaps that was why…

Not only did Miku’s way of speaking give off the impression that she did not hold a grudge against her father, Sakuya, she seemed to be treating him as some sort of stranger.

「Which means, when we met for the first time during the semen donation, you already knew that you and I were siblings, Miku-san?」

Miku nodded her head.

「Actually, a veteran staff member was supposed to be dispatched, but in the end, I was dispatched under special nomination form Inui-san. But Inui-san and the others told me to keep quiet about the fact that we were siblings until the right time came. When I met you for the first time, Yuu-sama, I thought, I have such a wonderful little brother, huh; and I couldn’t stop my heart from pounding. As it is, I am already prone to get excited, so…」

He thought she was just an innocent woman who had not immunity to men, but this was the first time Yuu had heard that she had such a circumstance.

「To my convenience, I am the only one who is on her 『lucky day』 today, so if you are so inclined, Yuu-sama, u, u-u-u, umm… your b, baby seed…」

「E, err… In other words, you want to have sex with me, your half-blood little brother?」

「Y… yes.」

Miku’s face turned bright red and she buried her face in Yuu’s chest in embarrassment.

It seemed that the convenience mentioned by Rumiko also meant the women who were in the fertile cycle of their menstrual period.

In other words, it was a condition to get them pregnant.

If Yuu had refused, Miku, who had happened to be chosen because her timing was right, would probably have gone home and felt despondent on her own.

On this occasion, the fact that Miku was his half-blood elder sister posed no obstacle at all in Yuu’s mind.

It was a matter of whether he wanted to embrace her as a woman or not.

In that sense, the fact that a certain part of his own body was reacting had served as proof.

「Miku-sa… let’s stop referring to each other as if we are strangers at this point. Or so I say, but if I call you big sis, I have a lot of older sisters, after all… Can I call you big sis Miku?」

「Big sis… Miku… Ufufu, it makes me so happy!」

When Miku raised her face, she ported a truly happy look on her face.

Perhaps because her tension had worn off, he felt the sex appeal of an older woman in that expression of hers.

「Then, you don’t need to add sama to my name. Just call me without any honorific.」

「Huh?! B, but…」

「I’m your little brother, so that’s only natural, no?」

「Y… Y… Yuu?」

「Yes, big sis Miku.」

「Yuu!」

Getting very emotional, the two of them wrapped their arms around each other and hugged each other tightly.

But Yuu suddenly realized something.

The fact that after learning self-defense techniques first thing in the morning, he came to the hospital after simply wiping off his sweaty body lightly.

As well as the fact that since the hospital was air-conditioned, his stay there was comfortable, but when he underwent the examination, he was so nervous that he had sweated again.

「I’m all sweaty, you see. I’m going to take a shower, so wait a minute.」

「For you to say that you are going to wash that off, how outrageous!」

「Huh?」

「E, err… I, I don’t really mind, you see. Even if you stay the way you are, I mean.」

Miku stuck her nose not only into the examination clothes he was provided and wore, but also the tee shirt underneath it, and sniffed his smell.

「Haan… You smell very good. My little brother’s smell is making me wet.」

In this world, it seemed that many women were aroused by the smell of men, and Miku in particular might have a severe smell fetish.

「You smell nice, too, big sis Miku.」

「Ahn. Your breath is hitting me… Kufufu… Hnn… Ahn!」

Yuu swept Miku’s long hair to her back, gradually moved up as he kissed her neck lightly, and took her tiny earlobe into his mouth.

After gently stroking the ear with his upper and lower lips as if he was going to eat it, he licked the area around it using his lips and tongue.

「Kuh… Nghh---, hnn---」

Holding Miku’s body, which was trembling slightly as she let out a stifled cry, with one arm, he stopped her face with his other hand as she tried to escape.

Making sloshing noises as he went all the way into her ear, he continued to caress her with his tongue, as if teasing her.

「Nghhiii! Hyan, n, not… my… ear… ahn… hnn!」

After a while, he whispered to Miku, who was showing a completely melty look on her face.

「Big sis Miku, I want to kiss you.」

「Nghh… Yuu… Nmm.」

The moment their lips came into contact with each other, both of them ended up letting out a 「「Nghh」」 moan.

As expected, it seemed that when you kissed someone who was related to you by blood, even if only half, for the first time, an electrifying pleasure ran through your whole body.

「Nghh… Ah… Yu… u… Hnn…」

「Bi… Nmm.」

With melty eyes, Miku wrapped her hands around Yuu’s head as she pressed her lips against his.

The two, whose arousal ended up skyrocketing in an instant, devoured each other’s lips thoroughly, both the top of bottom, as they exchanged kisses with each other.

Soon after, when Yuu stuck out his tongue and licked her lips, Miku was startled and opened her eyes wide, but perhaps feeling electrifying pleasure as their mucous membranes came into contact with each other, she began to assertively intertwine her tongue with his.

Even while they were exchanging deep kisses, Yuu’s hands never rested.

After combing her long hair, he moved his hand down from her slouched shoulder, and then gently stroked her entire back around.

With his other hand, he grabbed her buttocks tightly.

Although it was from over her gown, he could feel the softness peculiar to girls wherever he touched her.

He had heard that she was a little chubby, but her waist was perfectly slim, so if anything, it could be said that she had a curvy figure.

Coupled with the feels of her breasts squishily getting pressed against his chest, he nether region was seething.

「Hnn… Chuu, chuupa… B, big sis Miku…」

「Nghh, ahn, amm… Hnn, hnn, slurp! Haa, haa, Yuu…」

「Shall we move to the bed?」

「Yes…」

When the two reached the edge of the wide bed while still getting tangled in each other’s embrace, they fell onto their sides together as they were.

At the same time as getting on the bed, Miku took off her gown and stripped naked.

The upper half of her body, which she exposed liberally, was narrow in the shoulders and looked slender, but she boasted voluptuous breasts that swayed tantalizingly when she took off her gown.

Large buttocks that could be said to be of the easy delivery type. Plump thighs extending out from there.

In part because she sported plenty of bulges in the places that should bulge, her waist looked slimmer than he had expected.

「Ooh!」

Just as Yuu was about to immediately pounce on that body of hers, he was caught by Miku who had a wide smile on her face.

「Take off your clothes too, Yuu! Hurry up and get naked! Naked! Let me sniff your smell here and there directly-!」

「Yes…」

He ended up getting overwhelmed by Miku, who took one eighty and looked at him with serious eyes.

Why are my elder sisters all like this, I wonder? Yuu couldn’t help but hold such a doubt.

●○●○●○●○●

Not only did Yuu get stripped naked by the hands of Miku, who got more aroused the more he exposed his naked body, he even got licked by her on top of him.

「Haa, haa, Yuu… what a wonderful smell… your skin is also very smooth… Kufufu, I can’t get enough of it. Lick, lick, chuu, chuu, chuu, lick, slurp. Ahnn, sho tahty.」

Starting with his neck, Miku sniffed his smell as she kissed and sucked on his collarbone, shoulders, and chest.

When she took one of his arms and sniffed the armpit, she opened her loosened up mouth wide and licked it up over and over again.

He couldn’t understand why the mere smell of sweat excited her so much.

Deciding to let Miku do whatever she wanted for a while, Yuu stroked Miku’s head and put his other hand under her weighty breast, fondling her bountiful breast flesh.

「Kuha! B, big sis Miku, this is your first time doing it, no? You’re surprisingly skillful in it.」

As she moves from his armpit to his chest and sucks on his nipples, he couldn’t help but let out a groan.

「Ehehe, yes, this is my first time doing it. But since the day I met you for the first time, I’ve been doing image training every day, so… When I imagined that you would surely smell especially wonderful even when compared with other boys, I just couldn’t hold myself back!」

「Ha, haha… I see.」

「But as I suck on your body directly… my place down there grows hot and tingles, you see.」

So that was the reason why she had been rubbing her thighs together as she licked Yuu’s body since a while ago.

He pinched the tip of the breast he was fondling, the nipple, with two fingers.

「Kyan!」

「I want to caress you, too, you see, big sis Miku.」

「Ah… I, I’m sorry. Since I finally got to touch your body, I couldn’t help but get so absorbed in it.」

「It’s okay.」

While stroking Miku’s head, Yuu brought his face closer and pressed his lips against hers.

They raised their bodies and embraced each other again while twirling their tongues together.

Miku’s soft skin was directly touching Yuu’s skin, and the feeling, sweet aroma, and warmth of her body caused his arousal to shoot up wildly.

「Amm… Chuu, chuu, lick… Ahn, fwah… slurp, nghh… Yuu.」

「Fufufu. You gave off plain impression when we first met, but it turns out that you’re actually a very naughty girl, huh, big sis Miku.」

「Ahn! That place is… Hnn, fwaaah!」

When Yuu reached his fingers from her buttocks toward her vagina, a wet sound could be heard the moment he touched it, telling him that it was dripping wet.

Just by running his middle finger back and forth along the middle part of the charm, his finger immediately got covered by her love juice.

「B, back at you, Yuu. Your hot and hard thing has been hitting me since a while ago…」

As the two lowered their gazes, they could see Yuu’s rock hard, erect penis towering between his legs.

Miku looked at Yuu with moist eyes.

「P, please… let me s, smell… your dick.」

「Yes?」

He was now convinced that Miku, who wanted to smell it first, rather than to touch or suck it, was a legit smell fetishist.

As soon as she got Yuu’s permission, Miku buried her face in his crotch with a swift movement and started sniffing from the tip, it seemed.

Even though it had only been a day, his place down there was shrouded in sweat and ammonia smell, and looking at her getting absorbed in sniffing it, he couldn’t help but question her preference.

However, thinking about it the other way around, he would like to bring his face close to a beautiful girl’s vagina, even if it was a little sweaty. In other words, that was probably just how it was.

Not just a little bit, Miku seemed to be steeped fairly deep in her fetish.

「Mu, haa-. So this is… the smell of a boy’s dick… Suu, haa, suu, haa. Nghh---… Smelling such a thick male scent, I might end up getting addicted to it.」

「T, that’s… good for you, I guess.」

From Yuu’s position, he could not see Miku’s face, but her expression was loose and her mouth was gaping slovenly.

In addition, she was unconsciously shaking her ass side to side, and clear liquid was trickling down her thighs.

While checking the feel of his penis with her fingertips, Miku was sniffing it, pressing the tip of her nose against it as if it were a dog or a cat.

It was good that she was happy, but it was certainly a little unsatisfactory for Yuu, who had been in an erect state since a while ago.

If anything, for Yuu who had accumulated a fair amount of experience since entering high school, there was no way he was fine with letting Miku, a virgin, take control of the pace.

「Big sis Miku… Geez, big sis Miku!」

He put his hand on her head and called out several times, making her turn his head toward him.

「What is it-… Yuu?」

As Miku looked up at Yuu with a melty expression, a drool was dripping from the corner of her mouth.

「I’d like you to do as I say. I believe it won’t cause harm to either of us, perhaps.」

Turning up the corners of his mouth into a meaningful smile, Yuu suggested that they change positions.

What Yuu suggested was for Miku to get on top of him, who lied on his back, facing the opposite side.

In other words, the 69 position.

He didn’t know whether it was because this position was not very mainstream in this world, or if the women he had been with had simply been unaware of it because they were all virgins.

However, when he tried it with the three members of the student council, starting with Sayaka, they were hesitant to spread their legs and exposed their secret places on top of Yuu’s face at first, but once they started, they ended up getting absorbed in licking each other’s genitals.

「Mufufu… When we do it like this… I can feel the heat of your dick. Ohyoo! It’s making me excited!」

Even after the change in direction, Miku continued to rub her cheeks against his penis and press her nose against it, enjoying its scent as usual.

She occasionally kissed and licked it, but rather than caressing, these seemed to be acts that stemmed from her own curiosity.

Rather than forcing her to suck it, he was letting her, who was inexperienced, do whatever she wanted, but he couldn’t help but react to her warm breath and the feel of her soft, plump skin and lips.

Before he knew it, pre-cum started to leak out, which pleased Miku even more.

On the other hand, Miku’s 23-year-old virgin vagina was exposed defenselessly close to Yuu’s face.

Grabbing her thighs, he noticed that their inner sides were covered with traces of love juice, and even though she had just washed it, it was already brimming with the scent of a female in heat.

The juiciness of her vagina reminded him of ripe fruit.

First of all, as if to have a taste of it, he grabbed her soft and big ass, pulled it close to him, and then put his mouth on her vagina.

The area around his mouth immediately became wet and sticky, but Yuu sipped the juices without paying it any mind.

Slurp, slurp, slurp!

「Hyaun!」

He sucked it while sticking out his tongue to the limit and licking it up and down.

Splish, splish. Chuupu, sluuuuuuuurp!

「Hiin! Y, Yuu?! Ahii! S, sucking me, down there is… hyaa, ahiin!」

He could hear Miku’s voice, but Yuu’s cunnilingus did not stop.

Spreading the chasm with his fingers, he stuck his tongue as deep as possible into her vagina and moved it around.

「Ahn, ahn, ahn! Hyan… I can’t concentrate on your dick… Hiin! If you lick me so intensely… Ah… Aaaaahn! Wha! What?! Aun! That place is… Ahh, ahh, so good, it feels so good! I, I have never felt something like this… Auu, auu.」

After licking her entire vagina all over with his tongue and getting his face wet with love juices, Yuu shifted his position a little, turned over the hood with his fingertips, then changed his target to the protrusion he had probed with the tip of his tongue.

Just by giving it a little stimulation with the tip of his tongue, blood immediately gathered in the clitoris, making it swell up.

When he inserted the finger of his right hand halfway into her vagina and moved it from the second joint to the tip, it made a schlupping, sticky wet sound.

「Nghii… Hnn, ahn, hyaa… S, something is coming! Ahn! Aah… Yuu, Yuu, anymore than this will be… Aaaaah!」

No longer had the leeway to sniff his penis, all Miku could do was lie face down between Yuu’s legs and let out a muffled moan.

Sometimes, her body jerked up and quivered.

Paying no mind to such Miku, Yuu was absorbed in caressing her.

That was because at a time like this, being able to make the woman feel good would give you pleasure as a man.

As Yuu made use of his tongue liberally and licked her up in a bold manner, Miku raised her face and arched her upper body back.

「Haan, aaaaaaaah… Ahn, ahn, cumming! C, c, cumming! Yu…u… I, I am… Ahii! Hii… Hii, hiin! … C, cumming!」

Miku, whose body had been quivering from the pleasure that washed over her, went limp a short while later and plopped down to Yuu’s nether region, just like before.

「Omph!」

Maybe the lower half of her body had also gone limp at the same time, her crotch was pressed against Yuu’s face more strongly than before.

Since Miku had also failed to give him a satisfactory fellatio, Yuu was nowhere near close to reaching climax, and was itching to undo the 69 position and moved on to the main event.

But then a mischievous desire welled up inside him.

Yuu, who had been seized by a strange arousal after not only getting his face covered with love juice but also getting enveloped with the scent of a female in pleasure, changed the direction of his face and played with her clitoris by sandwiching it between his lips.

「Hiinghh! W, wa-wa-wa, wait a… hiiin! I, I came, I came already so! Ahn, you mustn’t lick me so intensely!」

In the end, Yuu continued the cunnilingus until Miku came one more time.

---

## Chapter 87 - Special Examination (4) -WHITE LOVE-

When he rolled Miku, who had just come continuously with cunnilingus and was completely drained of strength, onto her side and then raised his upper body to look at her, beastly desires blazed up inside of Yuu for that slovenly feminine body.

Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that even though they had done a 69, Yuu was still unable to reach climax.

「Big sis… Miku!」

「Ahn!」

Going on top of Miku, Yuu held his raging with his right hand, fitted it into her sopping wet vagina, and then inserted it into her in one go.

「Nghh, nghh, nghh, nghh, nghh… Ahh, hiii… it hurts… Yu… u… Ahh… Haan!」

「Ohh, ooh… Guh…」

Not noticing that Miku grimaced at the pain of defloration, Yuu got so absorbed in shaking his hips persistently.

Even though he encountered strong resistance from the vaginal flesh midway through it, he gradually completed the penetration by pistoning single-mindedly, and eventually poked the deepest part of the vagina.

「Oooh… Kahaa… Aah… It, it feels so… good…」

Feeling an electrifying pleasure running through his entire body, Yuu thought he would end up coming if he continued as he was, so he temporarily stopped moving his hips.

When he buried his face in her neck onto which her messy hair was stuck and was enjoying her feminine scent, Yuu came back to his senses.

Then he realized. The fact that he had gone and inserted himself into a virgin woman mindlessly, like a virgin who had obtained an opportunity to have sex for the first time.

Her forehead glistening with sweat, Miku still furrowed her eyebrows even now, but then she opened her eyes slightly, looked at Yuu and smiled.

「A, all of it is in… right? I feel like… my stomach is full with your dick, Yuu… Oh…」

「Ah… I’m sorry, big sis Miku! For doing it so forcefully. It, it must be painful, right?」

「Huh? It was certainly painful, but… there’s nothing for you to apologize for, you know, Yuu? A little bit of pain is nothing. I mean, it is in exchange for the womanly pleasure of being able to accept a man into her, after all. And if the other party is you, Yuu, it makes me all the more happy.」

「Big sis Miku!」

「Ahn… hnn…」

Sure enough, not only was Miku, who had her glasses off, tiny and cute in every way, she also boasted a figure that stirred one’s manly desires in spite of that.

If you were to ask men with the original world standard, in eight or nine cases out of ten, they would probably wish to make her their girlfriend.

However, compared to Elena and Sera, she was not so much of an exceptionally beautiful girl.

She was only on the level of a cute girl you caught sight of on the street every once in a while.

However, even though they had only met for a short time, she accepted him to such an extent as a little brother and as a man, so it was impossible for his affection for her to not grow stronger.

As he brushed her messy hair with his right hand, Yuu held her head and pressed his lips against hers.

As expected, kissing felt good.

Starting out with pecking-like kisses, they gradually moved to passionate kisses as they exchanged kisses for a long time.

Taking Miku’s right hand with his left hand, he intertwined their fingers to form a lover’s hold.

「Nnnh-n… Nmm, chuu, chuu, chuupa… Aahn, I can feel it… that your hard and hot dick is inside me… Hnn, ahn! No way, even though you’re not moving, I feel tingles in the depth of my belly! Nghh… Amm… Lick, slurp, chuuu…」

After exchanging deep kisses as if they were devouring each other’s mouths, Yuu pulled his lips away just a little and whispered with a smile.

「Are you okay now? Can I start moving?」

「Yes… Come to me, Yuu… Aahn!」

Starting it out slow, he went with a short-stroke pistoning to let her get accustomed to it.

Miku extended her right hand toward him as well, so he shook his hips lightly as they intertwined their fingers with both hands.

Compared to when he penetrated her at first, the stiffness of Miku’s body had eased, and the love juice that oozed out acted as a lubricant, making it easier for him to move.

This time, after pumping in and out of her a few times on the shallower parts, he thrust all the way into Miku’s deepest part in one go.

Each time he did, Miku reacted with a jerk and let out a higher and higher-pitched cry.

「Ahn, ahn, ahn! Ah… Haan, haan… Haun!」

「How is it? Are you starting to feel good?」

「Yu… u… nghh! Since a while ago, I’ve already been… Auun! Feeling, good!」

「Glad, to hear that… There!」

「Kyan! Geez… Yuu, stop teasing, your b, big sis…」

「Well, you’re so cute, so…」

While shaking his hips, Yuu was looking closely at Miku’s debauched figure as she lay on her back.

Her long black hair was spread freely and haphazardly across the pillow.

Her pale skin was now dyed pink and every time Yuu thrust his hips into her, she jerked her chin up as if unable to endure it, or moaned and shook her face from side to side as if trying to resist it.

But soon after, she opened her half-open eyes and looked at Yuu with her mouth half-open, which was really sexy.

Her ample breasts jiggled and swayed in sync with the movement of his hips.

Stretching out both of his hands, with the fingers still intertwined with Miku’s, and planting them on the bed to pin her down, he sealed her half-open, wet and glossy lips.

As they twirled their tongues together violently, Yuu’s arousal level went up, and the movements of his hips began to gradually increase in speed.

「Hnn, hnn, hnn, nghh! Hnn, ohh, ohh, ahh, nghh! Hnn… Yuu! Yuu! Auun! No… I feel like… something amazing is coming!」

「Are you about to cum? Sure, big sis Miku…come… there! 」

Leaning over Miku, Yuu buried his face in her moist, sweat-soaked neck as he poked her deepest part.

As a matter of fact, as he got clamped down by her tight vagina, which was unique to virgins, Yuu’s own pleasure had also gone up fairly high, and he was close to reaching his limit.

「Ahn, ahn, ahn-! No, that’s… too intense… cumming, cumming… Aahn! No more… I’m cumming… C, c, cumming---!!!」

Just as Miku, who squeezed his hands so tightly that fingernail marks were left behind on them, was about to reach climax, the folds of her vagina contracted and tightened as if trying to squeeze the sperm out of the penis that was buried deep inside her.

「Ahh… Mi… ku… Kaha… I’m gonna cum too… nghh!」

After a moment’s pause, Yuu was also assailed by pleasure that ran through his entire body from the waist, and as he failed to resist it, he ended up shooting off his sperm.

*Splurt, splurt, splurt* As if getting led to ejaculate on its own, giving him no time to delay the climax, he ended up pouring all of it into Miku.

「Ah… Aah… Haan… Yuu, it’s coming out… your hot stuff… so much of it… Ahaa… it’s so amazing…」

「Ha, haha…it felt crazy… good so… I couldn’t hold myself back.」

「Ufufu. Glad to hear that… Ahn.」

After the ejaculation continued for a while, he let go of the hands he had been holding, and then Miku wrapped her arms around Yuu’s back and hugged him tightly.

Yuu also hugged Miku back lovingly.

●○●○●○●○●

「Fwaaaah… Yuu’s semen and my naughty juices are mixed together, making a very lewd smell.」

Dogs and cats had a more developed sense of smell than humans, but when they smelled something that piqued that interest, they sometimes sniffed it while pressing their noses against it.

The current Miku was in such a state.

At the request of Miku, who wanted to smell it by all means, he pulled his penis, which still maintained its hardness, out of her vagina and thrust it in front of her eyes.

The person in question, Miku, had just experienced an intense loss of virginity and couldn’t move right away, so she was still lying on her back.

Instead, a big-sized pillow was placed in the back of her head.

Miku was enjoying his sopping wet penis while touching it with the tip of her nose and mouth.

「Ahaan… I feel like I’m going to get pregnant just from the smell.」

「I’ve actually filled you with a lot of baby seeds, so… Moreover, from what you said earlier, today is your… 『lucky day』, right?」

「Ufufu. You’re right. Amm, lick.」

Miku, with a very happy expression on her face, licked up the wet and shiny pole with her tongue.

As she did so, she pressed the tip of her nose against the glans, and the last of the semen that came out ended up sticking to it.

When Yuu pointed it out to her, she laughed 「Ehehe」, scooped it off with her finger, and then stretched out her red tongue to lick it off.

Then an idea occurred to Yuu.

She had big breasts, so he couldn’t afford not to put them to good use here.

「Say, big sis Miku, you can just stay as you are, so you see… I have a little favor to ask you.」

「Hmm?」

Miku looked up at Yuu with an innocent face.

●○●○●○●○●

 Yuu stood on his knees over Miku, making sure not to put his body weight on her stomach, and put his erect penis in the middle of her breasts.

They boasted such a volume that they could already sandwich it as it was, but he asked Miku to sandwich them from both sides with her arms folded at the elbows.

As she did so, the pressure from her breasts went up, making it feel even better.

「Th, th, this is…! Isn’t this what’s commonly known as 『Paiseme』?!」

「It’s also called paizuri.」

「E, either way, your dick is touching my boobs directly?! Aah… your dick is right in front of me!」

As Yuu began to slowly move his hips while having his penis sandwiched between her breasts, the glans popped out of her cleavage.

Coupled with the fact that she had sweated profusely on her chest area, his penis was still covered with moisture, so it seemed that they had enough lubricant to help with the movements.

When Miku lowered her chin, the glans ended up popping out right in front of her mouth.

「Ooh… Despite how soft they are, they give a perfect amount of fleshy pressure. It feels so good. If you can lick it while you’re at it, I bet it’s going to feel even better.」

「Ufufu. Then… Amm, lick.」

When he pushed his hips forward to make it easier for Miku to like it, the twin mounds rose one step higher along with it.

He shook his hips in small strokes, staying on the borderlines where the tip barely touched Miku’s mouth.

「Ahn… Dick… Don’t run away from me…」

Lowering her chin even more and leaning forward a little, Miku tried to suck on the penis with her tongue sticking out.

As she was, she began to lick it with her tongue and take it into her mouth.

「Nghh… so good… it feels really good. Big sis Miku.」

As he received not only breast pressure on the pole, but also stimulation from mucous membrane on the glans, Yuu’s pleasure began to shoot up.

「Ahaa… I’m also, happy to be able to suck your dick like this, Yuu… Nmm, chuupu, lick…」

「Haa, haa. Then, I’m going to cum just like this, but between swallowing it or having it sprayed on your face, choose the one that you like.」

「Hmm-… I’m torn, but… It’s a rare chance, so I want to swallow your semen, Yuu. Chuu, chuu… Ahaan, it has started letting out clear juices already!」

「Nghh… Your mouth and boobs… feel so good, after all.」

「Amm… Feel free to cum anytime you want, so give me a lot of it.」

*Chuu, chuu* Thinking that he would ejaculate faster if she did so, Miku took the glans into her mouth and sucked on it.

The paizuri continued for a while.

In addition to the sweat on her cleavage, Yuu’s pre-cum and Miku’s saliva also started to drip down, so the slipperiness went up a notch, making it feel even better.

Every time he pumped in and out, it made a slimy, sticky wet sound.

「Haa, nghh… Ahh, it feels good, big sis Miku… I think, I’m going to cum soon…」

「Amm… Lick, lick, chuupa… Hnn, nghh… your dick, is twitching…」

「Ahh, kuh… Guh!」

When Miku looked up, she saw Yuu making a strained look as he got closer to his limit, making her love for him grow even stronger.

As such, she tightened her armpits as much as she could as she stroked the pole with her breasts and licked and sucked the glans.

「Ahh, kaha… B, big sis Miku! Nghh, cumming, here I come!」

「Hnn… Nghh, nghh!」

Miku, perceiving that the time had come as Yuu placed his hand on her head, leaned forward and took his penis into her mouth in one gulp as if she was preying on it.

As soon as she felt the penis she had taken into her mouth tremble a little, *splurt* a gush of cloudy liquid came out and filled her mouth.

「Nghh, nmmm?!」

「A, aah… It, it came out.」

For Miku, each and every one of it was a new experience.

However, as she had personally said that she wanted to swallow it, she tightly pursed his lips to keep it from spilling out, and swallowed the juice, which was so thick that it might get stuck on her throat, one gulp after another.

She ended up spilling some of it, but there was nothing that could be done about it.

*Spurt, spurt* Not stopping after only one shot, the ejaculation lasted for several shots, and even after Yuu pulled his hips back a little, not only was there cloudy liquid peeking out of her gaping mouth still, there were also sticky white threads hanging from her lips.

●○●○●○●○●

Thirsty, Yuu opened the refrigerator installed in the room and took the liberty of taking out a can of tea and drinking it.

When he tried to give one to Miku, she said, 「If possible, I would like the one you are having」, so they drank the 350 ml can together.

She said that in the romance manga she read a long time ago, the scene where the heroine, who was given a can of juice that had been partially drunk by a boy, had an indirect kiss with the body as she drank it while turning bright red in the face left an awfully strong impression on her, leaving a yearning on her maiden’s heart.

For Yuu, it sounded like a common scene in romance manga, but for girls in this world, it was unrealistic and pretty much could only be seen in manga.

That was probably why they had such a strong yearning for it.

Even though they had exchanged so many deep kisses until just a moment ago, Miku held the can preciously with both hands and sipped it little by little, which Yuu found charming.

Right now, they were sitting shoulder to shoulder on the edge of the bed.

Having sweated a lot, they were thirsty, so they ended up emptying up the can of tea in no time at all.

After putting the empty can on a nearby drawer and sitting down again, Yuu held Miku’s shoulder in his arm.

Sporting a happy smile, Miku rested her head on Yuu’s shoulder.

Then, she gently put her hand on her lower abdomen.

「Fufufu. I’m sure Yuu’s sperm is doing its best swimming in my womb right now. Make sure you meet my egg and fertilize it, okay? You can do it!」

At this point, it should be hard to tell whether she would get pregnant or not.

Even so, Miku was calling out to the sperm in her womb, hoping to get pregnant with Yuu’s child.

「Say, big sis Miku」

「What is it-, Yuu?」

He noticed that by the time they were done with the paizuri, dusk was descending outside the window and the room was getting fairly darker.

For the time being, they had only turned on the bedside light, so although they could see each other’s faces, the shadows were deep.

She must have realized that it was almost time to say goodbye.

Moving from Yuu’s shoulder, Miku buried her face on his chest and rubbed her cheek against it.

As if she wished to sniff Yuu’s scent until the very last second.

When Yuu called to her, Miku raised her face and looked at him with her round and cute eyes.

「I wonder if the more semen poured into you, the more likely you are to get pregnant?」

「Hmm… I think so, probably.」

「Then… let’s do it one more time!」

「Huh? Huuh?!」

Yuu took Miku’s hand and invited her toward the center of the bed.

That was because if they did it around the edge of the bed, they might end up falling off due to impulsive bouncing.

With Miku in his arms, Yuu lay down on his back.

「This time, do want to try putting it in yourself, big sis Miku?」

「U, umm…! Your dick is?!」

Miku noticed that a hard object was pressed against her lower abdomen.

Earlier, she was so engrossed in her sniffing that she didn’t notice, but from what she remembered, she heard that once a man ejaculated, there would be a need to put an interval.

It was impossible for a man to get hard again in such a short period of time, which was almost no different from going continuously.

「Even though you have ejaculated twice… no way?」

「I can still keep going, you know. Now, let’s do it, shall we?」

「Ahn… Yuu…」

Miku, who was embraced in Yuu’s arms, expressed neither an agreement or a refusal.

Rather, she was so happy that she almost shed tears.

Placing her buttocks in the right position, she put her hand on his penis and adjusted the angle.

「L, like this?」

「Yes, just like that… Nghh.」

「Ah… Ahh, hnn! It, it, it’s coming… innghh…」

Making a squelching sound, Miku’s vaginal opening swallowed the glans.

This time, he thought it would be inserted into her relatively smoothly, but as expected, it was very tight inside Miku, who had just lost her virginity.

Holding each other’s hands, he slowly got connected with Miku, who was staring at him with feverish eyes.

「Ah, ah, aah! Hauu… Hii, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, aaaaaaaaaahn!」

「A, are you okay?」

Miku, who knitted her eyebrows, collapsed onto Yuu’s chest with a plop.

At that moment, *squiiish* her ample breasts were pressed hard against Yuu’s chest.

「Somehow… I managed to put it in, but… as I thought… y, your dick is so big, Yuu.」

「Fufufu… Inside of you… a, also feels very good, big sis Miku.」

「Nufufu. That makes me happy.」

Raising her face, Miku smiled and pressed her lips against his.

*Chuupa, chuupa* After exchanging kisses, Miku started shaking her hips.

*Jiggle jiggle* Ending up getting drawn to her breasts, which swayed wildly each time she did, he let go one of her hands, and then grabbed and fondled it, scooping it up from under her.

Eventually, as Yuu himself began to move and thrust his hips upward, Miku’s coquettish cry grew higher and higher in intensity.

## Chapter 88 - Weekend Plans -Confession-

It was the evening of the day after Yuu underwent the special examination at the Saitama University Hospital and had sex with his half-blood elder sister, Miku, at Rumiko’s request.

As soon as Yuu came home, he called Martina and Elena into the living room and brought up a matter to them, which immediately enveloped the room with tension.

This was because although Yuu had told them a long time ago that he had joined the student council, today he confided to them that he was in relationships with its three members (Sayaka, Riko, and Eimi) simultaneously.

Sayaka had a fiancé, which was decided by their families.

However, having been in a relationship in which they had connected in the bodies over and over again, it was clear that she had feelings for Yuu.

She had agreed to continue this relationship for the duration of this term of the student council at the very least.

Speaking of the woman that Yuu liked the most, it would be Sayaka, but he also liked Riko and Eimi, their fellow members of the student council.

He had also ended up having a love affair with a number of other girls, including Youko and Kazumi who were first-year students like him

For the time being, he needed to at least tell them that he was in relationships with the three members of the student council with whom he was closest.

Martina and Elena ended up freezing in place at the sudden confession.

Martina closed her eyes and thought about something.

Elena, on the other hand, was hanging her head, mumbling in a voice so low that others couldn’t hear it.

After a while, Martina opened her mouth with a resigned expression.

「I thought, or perhaps I hoped, you would get into those kinds of things at a much later date. Haa… Like father, like son, I guess.」

「Huh?」

「Hmm?」

Martina answered succinctly to Yuu and Elena who expressed voices of doubts.

「It means Yuu-chan is also Sakuya-san’s son.」

At her words, Yuu nodded his head in understanding, but Elena still seemed unconvinced.

「Well, Sairyou is a co-ed school, so I knew you would get into a relationship with a girl sooner or later, but… Don’t you think it’s still too early for you, Yuu? It’s only the first semester of your first year, you know? Can’t you wait until you become a second year…?」

「Compared to Sakuya-san, who had his first in the fifth grade, it’s still within the realm of common sense, I suppose?」

「Huh?」

As expected, it seemed Elena did not know the beginning of the Sakuya legend.

「As expected, I was surprised to hear that you are in relationships with the three of them simultaneously, but… We’re talking about Yuu-chan who is overflowing with boyish charms here, so I guess it can’t be helped. It’s better than having them fight over him and cause trouble. Rather, what I’m more interested in is what kind of girls the other parties are. C’mon, tell me more about them, okay?」

「Ah… Yes.」

Martina, who was facing Yuu, suddenly leaned forward.

Elena also seemed to be curious about it and was staring fixedly at Yuu.

As far as Yuu was concerned, he would like to end it with only a short confession, but now that they learned there were girls he was in relationships with, it was probably inevitable that they became curious about them.

Yuu resigned himself and began to talk.

「The first one is Sayaka-senpai, the student council president. She is the daughter of the president of Komatsu Group, a well-known manufacturer of motorcycles and cars.」

「「Huh?」」

「It seems their motto is 『Be accomplished in both the literary and military arts』, so not only does she have excellent grades, she also holds black belt in several martial arts. Suppressing the strong and supporting the weak, she is the model of a student council president, so she is popular among both boys and girls at school. Though, she also has a mischievous streak that sometimes gets out of control when she is absorbed in something, you see.」

Yuu knew from his short marriage that when you wanted to tell a woman the good side of another woman, it was not a good idea to mention her looks.

He deliberately didn’t mention her beautiful looks, and emphasized how wonderful of a personality Sayaka had.

Taking advantage of the fact that neither Martina nor Elena said anything, he continued and started talking about Riko and Eimi.

Focusing on the part where they had spent their time cooperating with each other in the student council, he also mentioned their respective family situations that he had heard so far.

Sayaka was the only one who not only had a father on the family register but also sisters.

Riko was an only daughter, born through artificial insemination.

Her mother was a business owner, albeit a small one, and she seemed to hope that Riko, who had been good at studying since childhood, would continue her study until college.

The only man living together with Eimi was her grandfather. Her mother was the youngest of three sisters.

When her mother went to an art vocational school after graduating from high school, she fell in love with a man she met during a vocational training program, leading to the birth of Eimi.

There were only a few female students whom Yuu had been able to find out about their family situation, but among them, Sayaka was the only one who had both parents. Even girls like Eimi, who were born naturally from their mothers’ relationship with a man, seemed to be in the minority.

On the other hand, when it came to boys, like Yuu, it was said that they were all born from natural insemination.

「Hmm, well, I have a general idea of what kind of girls they are. The other thing I’m curious about is, err, umm, which one of you proposed that you should be in relationship?」

「Of course, it was me!」

When Yuu declared so unabashedly, even Martina was taken aback.

For her part, she had feared that his seniors might have made a pass at him, but apparently it was nothing but a needless fear.

「The first person I fell in love with was Sayaka-senpai. It was pretty much love at first sight, you see. She was very considerate of me because I was her junior, but I pushed her hard… In hindsight, I feel like I was pretty forceful in asking her to go out with me. But Sayaka-senpai didn’t seem unhappy about it, so we immediately became lovers, I guess. Then we got found out by Eimi-senpai and Riko-senpai, who were always together with her. And since things had turned out like that, I decided to date the three of them simultaneously.」

Without mentioning the existence of her fiancé, Yuu told them that this was ultimately the result of him falling in love with her and making a move assertively.

Martina couldn’t help but smile at Yuu, who said it straight out so nonchalantly.

「Fu, fu, fu. I suppose you’re just like Sakuya-san in that regard, too. I can’t help but laugh.」

Elena remembered a scene from the past where Yuu told her that he had already lost his virginity.

「Then, you’re already in male-female relationships with those three?」

「Yes. Something like that.」

「Ah, I knew it…」

Then it occurred to Elena that she might end up becoming an 『aunt』 in her teens.

Moreover, it was one thing if the parent was her older sibling, but in this case, it was her younger sibling.

As Elena held her head in her hands, Yuu’s hand gently touched her.

「Big sis, there’s nothing to worry about, is there? No matter how many lovers I have, you will always be my big sister, you know? It seems I have a lot of elder sisters from different mothers, like big sis Sera, but not only are you the only one who was born from the same mother, you’ve taken care of me from the time I was a baby, after all.」

「Yuu…」

Even if they were dating or married, strangers would still be strangers. It was common for a temporary relationship to come to an end.

However, the ties between family members who were related by blood were unbreakable throughout their entire lives.

Though, it was common for the ties between brothers and sisters to fade if they lived far away from each other or had their own families, but the current Elena couldn’t think that far ahead.

At any rate, Elena speedily grabbed Yuu’s hand and took one-eighty, sporting a happy look on her face.

But then Martina said to Yuu in a calm voice.

「Say, Yuu-chan?」

「W, what is it, mom?」

He almost got overwhelmed by Martina’s intensity, which kept him from saying anything back.

「I won’t say right away, but one of these days, make sure to bring Sayaka, Riko, and Eimi to our house and let me meet them, okay?」

「Huh…?」

「I mean, rather than just hearing about them from you, I want to personally meet them and find out what kind of girls you are dating, Yuu-chan.」

「I, I want to meet them too!」

It was only at times like this that Elena immediately jumped on the bandwagon as well.

「Ah, err… We’re going to be busy with student council works, so…」

「Then when can you bring them over?」

Averting his eyes, Yuu looked at the calendar.

It was almost the middle of June.

Truthfully, he would like to avoid letting his lovers meet his mother.

So he had no choice but to postpone it as long as possible.

「W, when summer vacation starts…」

「It can’t be helped. Then I’ll look forward to it.」

「Y, yes. So, I have one more thing to tell you, but…」

For Yuu, this was the main business.

「Both Sayaka-senpai and I have our birthdays in June, so this coming Saturday, you see, we thought about holding a birthday party with the members of the student council, including me.」

「Oh, my.」

He would probably spend the 30th, his birthday, with his family.

Sayaka’s birthday had already passed.

As such, they had discussed holding it this coming weekend, which fell right in the middle.

「The place will be an apartment near the school where Sayaka-senpai lives alone. And then… on that day, I’ll drop by on my way home from school and stay the night there, so…」

He lived at home, so he had never stayed over until now.

For Yuu, who was mentally an adult, it was troublesome, but not only was he still a high school student status-wise, he also lived with his family, so there was nothing that he could do about it.

As such, so as to not cause them unnecessary worry, he thought he should tell them about it.

「Hmm…」

「Eeh…」

Sure enough, both Martina and Elena showed a complicated look on their faces when they heard Yuu’s words.

However, given that he was in male-female relationships with the girls, it was probably better than being all against it and forcing them to go to a hotel in town, or something.

As long as they took his safety into consideration, Yuu thought they had no choice but to accept.

The first to open her mouth was Martina.

「Umm, I also thought I had to tell you about it today, but actually I have to go on an overnight business trip starting Friday afternoon, and I won’t be back until Sunday noon, you see.」

「Huh, is that so?」

By the look on her face, he could tell that she didn’t really want to go.

「Honestly, I don’t want to go, but… starting this year I get more and more responsibilities, and the time I have to go on a trip increase, you see.」

She worked for a local newspaper company, but despite that, it seemed that she still had to go on a business trip outside the prefecture from time to time.

In other words, Martina had risen to such a position.

Martina started out as a part-time employee, but her hard work was highly regarded by the employees she worked with, and she climbed up the ladder to become an associate and then an employee.

Even now, if her superiors still highly regarded her performance and gave her a promotion, as a family, he believed that was a delightful thing.

However, Martina herself seemed to regret that as she got busier and busier, she got to spend less and less time with Yuu.

In addition to that, as someone standing in the managerial position, she was caught between her superiors and her subordinates, and as a former company employee himself, Yuu could easily imagine how mentally demanding it would be.

「Mom, I’m glad that they appreciate your hard work, but if you ruin your body or mind because of it, all of it will be for nothing, you know? If you’re okay with me, I’ll listen to your complaints or whatever, but please be sure to take proper breaks and try not to overwork yourself, okay?」

「Yes, yes. I’ve been making you worry all this time, but from now on, I’m going to pull myself together, so if there is anything that bothers you, please talk to me.」

「Yuu-chan, Elena… Ufufu. I thought you two were still just little kids, but before I know it, you have become such grown-ups.」

「I mean, I’m already an adult, after all. And I’m turning 19 this year.」

「I’ll be 16 years old at the end of this month, huh…」

「I suppose so. First of all, we have to celebrate Yuu-chan’s birthday in a grand way!」

「Ahaha. I’m looking forward to it.」

After the atmosphere became more relaxed, Martina continued the conversation.

「And then, I was thinking of holding a farewell party for Sera-chan, who is going back to Hokkaido this weekend, but… Yuu-chan won’t be home this weekend, right? And I’ll also be on a business trip, so…」

「「Ah!」」

The training period of Sera, who had been coming over to play on weekend, had come to an end, and she would be leaving this coming Sunday.

Regardless of her wishes, it seemed that there was a good chance that she would be assigned to the branch office in Hokkaido.

After they said goodbye here, they wouldn’t be able to meet each other so easily.

That was why, as a farewell party, Martina had planned to invite her to their house for a dinner, but the time didn’t align with her and Yuu’s convenience.

「If it’s Sunday noon, I think mom and I will be home, but taking into account big sis Sera’s departure time, I guess that’s not a good idea, huh…」

「You’re staying in the city, so you should be fine, but I might be late…」

「As expected, should we hold it on a different day of the week?」

「Then, I’ll ask Sera directly!」

It was already past work hours, so Elena decided to try calling the place where Sera was staying that she had asked her the other day.

The landline phone was located at the end of the living room, so they could overhear the conversation the two were having.

As they did, they could more or less understand what they were talking about.

Finishing the call, Elena came back to the sofa where Yuu and Martina were sitting with a wry smile.

「You see, Sera said that as long as she could see Yuu, everything is fine!」

「Haa… Fine. Mama should just go and focus on her work, right?」

「Mom.」

Yuu took Martina’s hand and comforted her, who was a little depressed by Sera’s too frank words.

「And then, you see, since she has Saturday off, she said she wants to go to Tobo Another World Park.」

Tobo Another World Park, or TAWP for short, was somewhat similar to the one that existed in Yuu’s former world, one of the best amusement parks in Japan, located in Chiba but bearing the name of Tokyo.

Based on medieval Europe, it was said to recreate a fantasy world of swords and magic, and even legendary creatures such as fairies and elves.

It seemed that characters taken from fairy tales and myths that would be popular with women, such as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, would greet you there in a large group.

Therefore, it was very popular among women from children to adults, and Yuu learned from TV that it was very crowded on weekends and holidays.

「In that case, why don’t we have her come over on Friday evening, have dinner, and then let her hang out with Elena on Saturday? You’ve never been there before either, have you, Elena?」

「I, I guess so.」

His elder sister, who was always sticking to him at home and was introverted and had few friends at school, had never been to TAWP, which was unusual for a girl her age.

This, too, would be a good opportunity for her.

「Then, let’s go with that, shall we?」

「Yes. What should we do for the dinner?」

「For such an occasion, how about getting some sushi? Sera-chan likes fish, doesn’t she?」

As such, it was decided that on Friday, Martina would go to work and directly go on a business trip, and Sera would come to stay over in the evening. The next morning, Elena and Sera would go to TAWP to play, and Yuu would stay over at Sayaka’s apartment after school.

On Friday night, Martina, who acted as stopper, would be gone.

As a result, just how out of control his two elder sisters would become?

For his part, Yuu didn’t not feel a little bit scared, but deep down, his heart was pounding wildly in anticipation, and he was looking forward to the weekend.
